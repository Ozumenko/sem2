TEXT A: COMPUTER CONCEPTS
At present we live in the information age. It is a period of history when information is easy to access and it affects many aspects of everyday life. The importance of information is not new. It has always been a powerful tool. The information age is unique because of its underlying technology based on digital electronics. The digital revolution offers advantages, but requires adaptations. Digital innovations require societies to make adjustments to traditions, lifestyles and legislation. Digitization is the process of converting text, numbers, sounds, photos and video into data that can be processed by digital devices. The significant advantage of digitization is that things as diverse as books, movies, songs, conversations, documents, and photos can all be distilled down to a common set of signals that do not require separate devices. Data processing is based on an input-processing-output cycle which is often referred to as the IPOS cycle. The digital era has evolved through four phases, beginning with big, expensive computers and progressing to modern digital world in which small inexpensive digital devices are everywhere.
Data processing is the computing model for the first phase of the digital revolution.In the first phase computers were huge, complex and expensive devices. They existed in limited numbers, primarily housed in big corporations and government agencies. Computers and data processing became crucial tools for effective business operations. The second stage was presented by personal computing which is characterized by small, standalone computers powered by local software. Local software refers to any software that is installed on a computer’s hard disk. The third phase of the digital revolution materialized as computers became networked and when the Internet was opened to public use. A computer network is a group of computers linked together to share data and resources. The Internet is a global computer networ koriginally developed as a military project, and was then handed over to the National Science Foundation for research and academic use. The Web (short for World Wide Web) is a collection of linked documents, graphics, and sounds that can be accessed over the Internet. A key aspect of the Web is that it adds content and substance to the Internet. From 1996 – 2010 computing was characterized by the Web, e-mail, multiplayer games, music downloads and
6

enormous software applications. Then Facebook, Twitter and Google Apps have sent computing in new directions.
Cloud computing characterizes the fourth phase of the digital revolution. Cloud computing provides access to information, applications, communications and storage over the Internet. Before cloud computing most computers ran software based locally. With cloud computing all that changes. You can store your data in the cloud, making it available no matter what computer you use. Using a cell phone service provider your mobile device accesses the Internet. The touchscreen on your mobile gives you access to apps that play music, show movies, report news. You use Google or Wikipedia to access information and when you need to produce a document, you head over to Google to access its cloud-based word processor. You spend lots of time maintaining your profiles on social networking services and interacting with friends through cloud-based social media.
Computers do so many things and come in such a variety of shapes and sizes that it might seem difficult to distil their common characteristics into an all-purpose definition. A computer is a multipurpose device that accepts input, processes data, stores data, and produces output, all according to a series of stored instructions. Computer input is whatever is typed, submitted or transmitted to a computer system. An input device gathers data and transforms it into electronic signals for the computer to store and manipulate. Output is the result produced be a computer. Some examples of computer output include reports, documents, music, graphs and pictures. Output devices display, print, or transmit the results of processing. Computers manipulate data in many ways, and this manipulation is called processing. In a computer most processing takes place in a component called the central processing unit or CPU. The CPU of most modern computers is a microprocessor, which is an electronic component that can be programmed to perform tasks based on data it receives. A computer stores data so that it will be available for processing. Memory is an area of a computer that temporarily holds data waiting to be processed, stored, or output. Storage is the area where data can be left on a permanent basis when it is not immediately needed for processing. Data is typically stored in files. A computer file is a named collection of data that exists on a storage medium. The series of instructions that tells a computer how to carry out processing tasks is referred to as a computer program or simply a program. These programs form the software that sets up a computer to do a specific task.
Computers run two main types of software: application software and system software. A computer can be applied to many tasks, such as writing, number crunching, video editing, and online shopping. Application software is a set of computer programs that helps carry out a task. Word processing software, for example, helps people edit and print documents. Software application is sometimes referred to as apps, especially in the context of handheld devices. Whereas application software is designed to help a person carry out a task, the primary purpose of system software is to help the computer system monitor itself in order to function efficiently. An example of system software is a computer operating system (OS),
7

which is essentially the master controller for all the activities that take place within a computer.
At one time there were three distinct categories of computers: mainframes, minicomputers and microcomputers. Now commonly used computer categories include personal computers, servers, mainframes and supercomputers. A personal computer is a microprocessor-based computing device designed to meet the computing needs of an individual. It provides access to a wide variety of local and cloud-based applications. In the computer industry, the term server has several meanings. It can refer to computer hardware, to a specific type of software, or to a combination of hardware and software. In any case, the purpose of a server is to serve computers on a network by supplying them with data. A mainframe computer is a large and expensive computer capable of simultaneously processing data for hundreds or thousands of users. Mainframes are generally used by businesses or governments to provide centralized storage, processing and management for large amounts of data. Mainframes remain the computer of choice in situations where reliability, data security and centralized control are necessary. A computer falls into the supercomputer category if it is one of the fastest computers in the world. Because of the speed, supercomputers can tackle complex tasks and compute-intensive problems that just would not be practical for other computers.
A computer-intensive problem is one that requires massive amounts of data to be processed using complex mathematical calculations. Handheld digital devices include familiar gadgets such as iPhones, iPads, iPods, Garmin GPSs, Droids and Kindles. These devices incorporate many computer characteristics. They accept input, produce output, process data and include storage capabilities. Handheld devices vary in their programmability and their versatility. The term workstation has two meanings. It can simply refer to an ordinary personal computer that is connected to a network or to powerful desktop computers used for high-performance tasks, such as medical imaging and computer-aided design, that require a lot of processing speed.

TEXT B: DIGITAL DATA REPRESENTATION AND PROCESSING READING
Read the text and answer the following questions.
1. Is there a difference between data and information? 2. What is data representation?
3. How does digital data work?
Computers and other digital devices work with such things as texts, numbers, music, images, speech, and video. The amazing aspect of digital technology is that it distills all these different elements down to simple pulses of electricity and stores them as 0s and 1s. Data refers to the symbols that represent people, events, things, and ideas. In everyday conversation people use the terms data and information interchangeably. Nevertheless, some technology professionals make a distinction between the two terms. They define data as any raw facts or observations that describe a particular phenomenon that represents people, events, things and ideas. Data becomes information when it is presented in a format that people can understand and use. Data is used by machines, such as computers, information is used by humans. Information is simply data that has a particular meaning within a specific context. Information may be data that has been processed in some way. When we speak of data processing, the input is data, the output is useful information. So, data processing is a series of actions or operations that convert data into useful information.
Data representation refers to the form in which data is stored, processed, and transmitted. For example, devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers store numbers, text, music, photos, and videos in formats that can be handled by electronic circuitry. Those formats are data representations. Data can be represented using digital or analog methods. The term to digitize means to convert raw, analog data into digital format represented by 0s and 1s. A photograph or drawing can be digitized by treating it as a series of colored dots. Each dot is assigned a binary number according to its color. A digital image is simply a list of color numbers for all the dots it contains. In a similar way, music can be digitized by assigning binary codes to notes.
Digital data is text, numbers, graphics, sound, and video that have been converted into discrete digits such as 0s and 1s. In contrast, analog data is represented using an infinite scale of values. Most computers use the simplest type of digital technology – their circuits have only two possible states. For convenience, let’s say that one of those states is «on» and the other state is «off». When discussing these states, we usually indicate the «on» state with 1 and the «off» state with 0.
11

These 1s and 0s are referred to as binary digits. It is from this term that we get the word «bit» – binary digit. Computers use sequences of bits to digitally represent numbers, letters, punctuation marks, music, picture, and videos.
Numeric data consists of numbers that might be used in arithmetic operations. Computers represent numeric data using the binary number system, also called «base 2». The binary number system has only two digits: «0» and «1». No numeral like «2» exists in this system, so the number «two» is represented in binary as «10» (pronounced «one zero»). The important point to understand is that the binary number system allows computers to represent virtually any number simply by using 0s and 1s, which is conveniently translated into electrical «on» and «off» signals.
Character data is composed of letters, symbols, and numerals that are not used in arithmetic operations. A digital computer uses a series of bits to represent letters, characters, and numerals. Computers work with digital data under the control of a computer program. Computer programmers create programs that control digital devices. These programs are usually written in a high-level programming language, such as C, C++, Python or Java. An important characteristic of most programming languages is that they can be written with simple tools, such as a word processor and they can be understood by programmers. The human-readable version of a program created in a high-level language by a programmer is called source code. Computers employ several types of codes to represent character data, including ASCII, EBCDIC and Unicode. ASCII (pronounced «ASK ee», American Standard Code for Information Interchange,) requires only seven bits for each character. ASCII provides codes for 128 characters. A superset of ASCII, called Extended ASCII, uses eight bits to represent each character. Using eight bits instead of seven bits allows Extended ASCII to provide codes for 256 characters. Unicode (pronounced «YOU ni code») uses sixteen bits and provides codes for 65,000 characters.
The procedure for translating source code into 0s and 1s can be accomplished by a compiler or an interpreter. A compiler converts all the statements in a program in a single batch and the resulting collections of instructions, called object code, is placed in a new file. Most of the program files distributed as software contain object code that is ready for the processor to execute. As an alternative to a compiler, an interpreter converts and executes one statement at a time while the program is running. After a statement is executed the interpreter converts and executes the next statement. A microprocessor is hard-wired to perform a limited set of activities, such as addition, subtraction, counting and comparisons. This collection of preprogrammed activities is called an instruction set. Instruction sets are not designed to carry out any specific task, such as word processing or playing music. Instead, an instruction set is designed to be general purpose so that programmers can use it in creative ways for the wide variety of tasks performed by all kinds of digital devices. The list of codes for a microprocessor’s instruction set, called machine language, can be directly executed by the processor’s circuitry. A set of machine language instructions for a program is called machine code. To avoid confusion, most computer files contain a file header with information about the code used to represent the file data. A file header can be read by the computer, but never appears
12

on the screen. By reading the header information, a computer can tell how a file’s contents were coded.
A single high-level instruction is often converted into multiple machine language instructions. A programmer creates human-readable source code using a programming language. A compiler or an interpreter converts source code into machine code. Machine code instructions are a series of 0s and 1s that correspond to a processor’s instruction set. A microprocessor contains miles of microscopic circuitry and millions of miniature components divided into different kinds of operational units, such as the ALU and the control unit. The ALU (arithmetic logic unit) is the part of the microprocessor that performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction. It also performs logical operations, such as comparing two numbers to see if they are the same. The ALU uses registers to hold data that is being processed. The microprocessor’s control unit fetches each instruction. Data is loaded into the ALU’s registers. Finally, the control unit gives the ALU the green light to begin processing. The instructions that a computer is supposed to process for a particular program are held in memory. When the program begins the memory address of the first instruction is placed in a part of the microprocessor’s control unit called an instruction pointer. The control unit can then fetch the instruction by copying data from that address into its instruction register. From there, the control unit can begin processing. The ALU is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. It uses registers to hold data ready to be processed. When it gets the go-ahead signal from the control unit, the ALU processes the data and places the result in an accumulator. When the computer completes an instruction, the control increments the instruction pointer to the memory address of the next instruction, and the instruction cycle begins again.

TEXT C: PASSWORD SECURITY
READING
Read the text and find the answers to the questions.
1. What are the most common authentication protocols? 2. What is the difference between a password and a PIN? 3. How serious is password theft?
4. What is password manager software?
User IDs, passwords, and personal identification numbers (PINs) are a fact of everyday life in the information age. They are required for activities such as using ATMs and debit cards, logging in to Windows, accessing wireless networks, making an iTunes purchase, instant messaging, and reading e-mail. Many Web sites encourage you to sign up for membership by choosing a user ID and password. Security experts use the term authentication protocol to refer to any method that confirms a person’s identity using something the person knows, something the person possesses, or something the person is. For example, a person might know a password or PIN, possess an ATM card or a credit card. A person can also be identified by biometrics, such as a fingerprint, facial features, or a retinal pattern. Authentication protocols that use more than one means of identification are more secure than others. Computer-related security is primarily based on passwords associated with user IDs. The level of protection depends on good password selection and management on the part of users. A user ID is a series of characters – letters, numbers or special symbols
  15

– that becomes a person’s unique identifier. It is also referred to as a user name, login, screen name, online nickname, or handle. User IDs are public. Because they are not secret, they do not offer any level of security. The rules for creating a user ID are not consistent throughout all applications, so it is important to read instructions carefully before finalizing your user ID.
A password is a series of characters that verifies a user ID and guarantees that you are the person you claim to be. Login screens for many applications provide a «forgot my password» link. A personal question provides an alternative authentication protocol to ensure that you are not a hacker pretending to be a legitimate user who has lost a password. Both passwords and PINs are classified as something-the-user-knows authentication methods. In practice, PINs tend to be a short sequence of numbers that can be entered using a numeric keypad, whereas passwords tend to be longer sequences of letters, numbers and special characters that require a full qwerty keyboard for entry. PINs are commonly used with two-factor authentication protocols, whereas passwords are used in conjunction with single- factor authentication protocols.
Password hacking is a big serious problem in many countries. To a hacker obtaining the password for a specific user ID is rewarding because he can get into personal information. When someone gains unauthorized access to your personal data and uses it illegally, it is called identity theft. Armed with your password and other personal data, a cybercriminal can use your credit card, apply for a mortgage using your financial data, and create fake accounts in your name. It is important to understand how hackers get passwords and how you can protect yours. Hackers employ a whole range of ways to steal passwords: shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, sticky notes. The brute force attack uses password-cracking software. Because it exhausts all possible combinations of letters to decrypt a password, a brute force attack can run for days to crack some passwords. If a hacker doesn’t have physical access to your work area but your computer is connected to a network, your password can be discovered by a hacker using a remote computer and software tools that systematically guess your password. Another technique is called sniffing, which intercepts information sent out over computer networks. Sniffing software is used legitimately by network administrators to record network traffic for monitoring and maintenance purposes. The same software can also be used for illicit activities. If your user ID and password travel over a network as unencrypted text, they can easily fall into the hands of a password thief. An even more sophisticated approach to password theft is phishing, in which a hacker poses as a legitimate representative of an official organization such as your ISP or an online payment service in order to persuade you to disclose highly confidential information. As users became better at identifying phishing messages, password thieves resorted to the use of key loggers. A key logger is software that secretly records a user’s keystrokes and sends the information to a hacker. A key logger is a form of malicious code called a Trojan. Trojans are computer programs that seem to perform one function while actually doing something else. They can be embedded in e-mail attachments, software downloads, and even files. With password theft becoming more and more
16

widespread, security experts recommend using a strong, secure password for financial transactions. A strong, secure password is one that is easy to remember but difficult to crack.
To protect your password, you must take steps to keep it safe. Do not share your password with anyone. Avoid writing down a password. Memorize it. If you think one of your passwords has been compromised, change it immediately. You can accumulate many passwords and user IDs – for logging in to Windows, accessing online banking, using e-mail, shopping online, downloading music, and getting into your Facebook account. The more passwords and user IDs you have, the more difficult they become to remember. First select a unique user ID that you can use for more than one site. Next, you can maintain two or three tiers of passwords.
Your computer’s operating system, Web browser, or other software might include a password manager to help you keep track of user IDs and passwords. A password manager stores user IDs with their corresponding passwords and automatically fills in login forms. Standalone password manager software offers a more inclusive approach to creating and retrieving passwords. A standalone password manager stores user IDs and passwords in an encrypted file. You can access this file using a master password. A standalone password manager can also generate secure «nonsense passwords».
In addition to generating and tracking your passwords, most password manager software provides other features, such as password strength meters and form fillers. A password strength meter indicates whether your passwords are secure enough – a feature that is useful if you’ve created your own passwords, rather than using your password manager to generate them. Form fillers automatically enter data into online Web forms such as those that request billing data when you order at an online shopping site. Many form fillers also match a Web form’s URL against a set of valid URLs that you have provided in order to avoid sending data to a fake Web site that you have been lured to visit by a phishing message. When entering passwords, form fillers are not collecting your password from the keyboard; therefore, a hacker’s key logger cannot secretly record keystrokes.
There are several free, shareware, or open source password managers, such as KeePass and Kaspersky Password Manager. Some password manager software is portable, which means that it does not have to be installed on a computer before it is used. Instead, you can carry it around on a USB flash drive so that your passwords are available wherever you use a computer. New password management techniques are being developed, but some offer their own set of potential security problems. For example, Web-based password managers can be attractive targets for password thieves. By breaking into a single site, a password thief could harvest thousands of passwords. As new password management technologies appear, make sure you evaluate them carefully before trusting them with your valuable data.

TEXT A: PERSONAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS
handheld
A stationary desktop computer is placed on a desk and runs on power from an electrical wall outlet. It contains the internal nodes of the personal computer and peripheral devices: system unit; keyboard; mouse; display system; hard disk drive; optical drive; removable storage; sound system; network and Internet access; printer.
PORTABLE COMPUTERS
A portable computer is a small, lightweight personal computer with input,
output, storage, and processing components integrated into a single unit that runs on power supplied by an electrical outlet or a battery.
Types of portable personal computers: an enhanced media player; a smartphone; a tablet computer; laptops or notebooks; netbooks.
Computers that operate in essentially the same way and use the same software are said to be compatible or having the same platform.
MICROPROCESSOR BASICS
A microprocessor (or a «processor») is an integrated circuit designed to
process instructions. It is the largest chip on the system board. A microprocessor can be referred to as a CPU on a chip because it performs essentially the same tasks as the central processing unit (CPU) of a classic computer. The list of instructions that a microprocessor can perform is called its instruction set. These instructions are hard-
21

wired into the processor’s circuitry. A microprocessor’s performance is affected by several factors, including clock speed, bus speed, word size, cache size, instruction set, number of cores and processing techniques.
The speed of the microprocessor clock – a timing device that sets the pace for executing instructions – indicates the speed the processor can execute instructions. It is usually specified in Gigahertz (GHz).
A cycle is the smallest unit of time in a microprocessor universe. Every action a processor performs is measured by these cycles. The clock speed is not equal to the number of instructions a processor can execute in one second. In many computers, some instructions occur within one cycle, but other instructions might require multiple cycles. Some processors can execute several instructions in a single clock cycle.
Word size means the number of bits that a microprocessor can manipulate at one time. Word size is based on the size of the ALU and the capacity of circuits that lead to those registers. The larger word size – the higher is computer performance.
Cache or «RAM cache» or «cache memory» is special high-speed memory that allows a microprocessor to access data more rapidly than from memory located elsewhere on the system board. Cache capacity is usually measured in megabytes (MB). A large cache can increase computer performance.
Some processors execute instruction «serially» – that is, one instruction at a time. With serial processing, the processor must complete all steps in the instruction cycle before it begins to execute the next instruction. Using a technology called pipelining, a processor can begin executing an instruction before it completes the previous instruction. With parallel processing, multiple instructions are executed at the same time. The idea of Hyper-Threading technology is to break each physical core into two virtual ones. Theoretically, in this case, twice as much information can pass through each core. However, Hyper-Threading technology will not give the same performance as a larger number of real physical cores. A microprocessor that contains circuitry for more than one processing unit is called a multi-core processor. More cores usually produce faster performance.
A microprocessor with an increasingly complex instruction set, each requiring several clock cycles for execution, uses CISC (complex instruction set computer) technology. A microprocessor with a limited set of simple instructions uses RISC (reduced instruction set computer) technology. Most processors in today’s desktop and laptop computers use CISC technology. Many processors used in handheld devices are ARM (advanced RISC Machine) processors.
COMPUTER MEMORY: RAM, ROM, EEPROM, BIOS, UEFI
RAM (random access memory) or dynamic RAM (DRAM), is a temporary holding area for data, application program instructions, and the operating system. RAM holds raw data waiting to be processed, the program instructions for processing that data, the results of processing until they can be stored more permanently. The instructions are loaded into RAM every time you start your computer. The RAM module is a volatile device and when you turn off or restart the computer all the stored information will irretrievably disappear, and it will not be possible to restore it
22

just like on a hard disk. Today’s personal computer operating systems are quite adept at allocation RAM space to multiple programs. If a program exceeds its allocated space, the operating system uses an area of the hard disk, called virtual memory, to store parts of programs or data files until they are needed. The more data and programs can fit into RAM, the less time your computer will spend moving data to and from virtual memory.
Whereas RAM is temporary and volatile, ROM (read-only memory) is permanent and non-volatile. The contents of ROM are «hard-wired» in the circuitry and remain in place even when the computer power is turned off. Newer EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) is a type of ROM that is non- volatile but user-modifiable. A ROM or EEPROM chip along with its instructions is commonly referred to as firmware. Today, the term ROM is used when referring to either ROMs or EEPROMs.
ROM contains a small set of instructions and data called the bootstrap loader. In a PC, the contents of ROM are sometimes referred to as the BIOS (basic input/output system).The bootstrap loader’s instructions tell the computer how to access the hard disk, find the operating system, and load it into RAM. After the operating system is loaded, the computer can understand your input, display output, run software, and access data files. The bootstrap loader requires some basic information about storage, memory, and display configuration. That data is stored in ROM along with the bootstrap loader instructions. In rare cases, the bootstrap loader instructions must be changed in ROM. If you change basic hardware, the bootstrap loader data must be updated. Some operating systems recognize hardware changes and automatically update the configuration data stored in ROM. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) being more effective is used instead of BIOS.
CMOS MEMORY. To operate correctly, a computer must have some basic information about storage, memory, and display configurations. The information is held in CMOS, a type of chip that requires very little power to hold data. It can be powered by a small battery that is integrated into the system board and automatically recharges while your computer power is on. The battery trickles power to the CMOS chip so that it can retain vital data about your computer system configuration even when your computer is turned off. When you change the configuration of your computer system, the data in CMOS must be updated.

7. What are the types of optical storage technology?
8. What is solid state storage?
9. What is the best use for USB flash drives?
A data storage system has two main components: a storage medium and a storage device. The term «storage technology» refers to a storage device and the media it uses.
25

A storage medium (media) is the disk, tape, CD, DVD, paper, or other substance that contains data. A storage device is the mechanical apparatus that records and retrieves data from a storage medium.
A computer works with data that has been coded into bits that can be represented by 1s and 0s. These 1s and 0s are transformed into changes in the surface of a storage medium. How this transformation happens depends on the storage technology. Three types of storage technologies are used for personal computer: magnetic, optical, and solid state.
Storage devices are compared using such criteria as versatility, durability, speed, and capacity.
The hard disk drive is not very versatile: it can access data only from its fixed disk platters. Hard disk drives are susceptible to damage that could cause data loss. Other technologies (CDs, DVDs or flash drives) can be more durable. Data transfer rate is the amount of data a storage device can move per second from the storage medium to the computer. Access time is the average time it takes a computer to locate data on the storage medium and read it. Random access (also called direct access) is the ability of a device to jump directly to the requested data. Fast storage devices are preferred over slower devices. Storage capacity is the maximum amount of data that can be stored on a storage medium.
MAGNETIC STORAGE TECHNOLOGY. Magnetic storage stores data by magnetizing microscopic particles on a disk or tape surface. Data stored magnetically can be easily changed or deleted simply by changing the magnetic orientation of the appropriate particles on the disk.
Hard disk drive is a device for storing information on the principle of magnetic recording. A hard disk is one or more platters and their associated read- write heads. Hard disk platters rotate as a unit on the spindle to position read-write heads over specific data. A read-write head mechanism in the disk drive magnetizes particles to write data, and senses the particles’ polarities to read data. The density of particles on the disk surface provides hard disks with great capacities. A hard disk drive mechanism includes a circuit board called a controller that positions the disk and read-write heads to locate data.
OPTICAL STORAGE TECHOLOGY. CD and DVD technologies are classified as optical storage, which stores data as microscopic light and dark spots on the disc surface. The disk is quite durable and data less susceptible to environmental damage than data recorded on magnetic media. Optical technologies can be grouped into read-only, recordable, and rewritable.
Read-only technology stores data permanently on a disc. This technology uses a laser to store and read data which is represented as microscopic light and dark spots on the disk surface. The spots reflect the light differently. As the laser lens reads the disk, these differences are translated into the 0s and 1s that represent data.
Recordable technology (R) uses a laser to change the color in a dye layer beneath the clear plastic disk surface. The laser creates dark spots in the dye that are read as pits. The change in the dye is permanent.
26

Rewritable technology (RW) uses phase change technology to alter a crystal structure on the disk surface. The crystal structure can be changed from light to dark and back again many times.
SOLID STATE STORAGE or flash memory is a technology that stores data in erasable, rewritable circuitry, rather than on spinning disks. Solid state storage is durable, removable and provides fairy fast access to data because it includes no moving parts.
Compact storage cards can be classified as solid state storage, which stores data in a non-volatile, reusable, low-power chip.
A memory card is a flat, solid state, non-volatile medium. A card reader is a device that reads and writes data on solid state storage. Many desktop and laptop computers have a built-in card reader.
A solid state drive (SSD) is a package of flash memory that can be used as a substitute for a hard disk drive.
The term USB (Universal Serial Bus) is a standard type of connection for various devices. A USB flash drive is removable and rewritable. It plugs directly into a computer’s system unit using a built-in connector. It is durable and requires no card reader. Often flash drives are used to update the BIOS or UEFI (
motherboards.
A USB-storage device supports encryption, which is not unimportant for the safe storage of information. Flash drives can be used as a key for activation (USB Keys)
applications.
BASIC INPUT DEVICES include: a keyboard; a mechanical or optical
mouse; a scanner; a digital camera; a microphone; a trackpad (touchpad/touchscreen). Some devices require software, called a device drive to set up communication between your computer and the device. The USB port can automatically detect a newly connected device and attempt to establish the setting necessary for sending
data between it and the computer.
OUTPUT DEVICES are computer hardware; they are connected via special
connectors, directly to the motherboard or expansion cards. An output device can be absolutely any device that will help you get information in the form in which it will be possible to perceive it.
The devices that perform information output from the computer are: display devices and all sorts of audio devices.
A computer display system includes a display device such as a monitor and graphics circuitry that generates the signals for displaying an image on the screen.
A computer monitor is usually an LCD (liquid crystal display) producing an image by manipulating light within a layer of liquid crystal cells. Image quality is a factor of screen size, dot pitch, width of viewing angle and color depth. LCD technology is now being replaced by LED (light-emitting diode) technology which is more environmentally friendly.
  Extensible Firmware Interface)
27
UEFI-enabled machines have faster
Unified
  startup and shutdown times as compared to BIOS-based machines.

Audio devices facilitate the output of sound information. A sound card is an expansion board or a built-in integrated chipset to create sound on a computer. As a rule, a sound card or sound chip is supplied with the firmware on the disc.
A computer printer is an output device that produces computer-generated text or graphical images on paper. A computer sends data for a printout to the printer along with a set of instructions on how to print that data. The data that arrives at a printer along with a set of instructions and its printer language requires memory. Printers differ in resolution, print speed, duty cycle, duplex capability, memory and networkability.
The advantage of a net work-enabled printer is that it can connect directly to a computer network; it can be placed in a location convenient for all the network users. It might be useful for printing from handheld devices that cannot be connected to a printer by cable. A plotter is a device that allows reproducing high-precision drawings, maps, schemes and other information on paper.
COMPREHENSION
Look through the passage and write your question about its content.
In addition to a display device, such as a monitor, a computer display system also requires graphics circuitry that generates the signals for displaying an image on the screen. One type of graphics circuitry, referred to as integrated graphics, is built into a computer’s system board. A second option, called dedicated graphics, is graphics circuitry mounted on a small circuit board called a graphics card. A graphics card contains a graphics processing unit (GPU) and special video memory, which stores screen images as they are processed but before they are displayed.

For trouble-free computer use, it is important to secure and regularly maintain your computer equipment. Computers are prime targets for thieves. You may use some important tips for protection your portable computer from theft.
• Never leave your portable computer unattended, especially when you at a coffee shop, the library or the airport.
• If you have to leave your portable computer in your car, never leave it in plain view. Lock it up in the trunk or cover it up.
• Carry your portable computer in an inconspicuous carrying case.
• Record your portable computer’s make, model, and serial number and store them away from the computer.
• Consider securing your portable computer with an anti-theft device. 29

Your chances of recovering a stolen computer improve if you have taken some steps in advance, such as recording the computer’s serial number, affixing a tracking label, or installing tracking software.
STOP (Security Tracking of Office Property) plates leave an indelible tattoo on your computer equipment, which contains a unique ID number registered in the international STOP database. Tracking and recovery software, such as CyberAngel and LoJach for Laptops, secretly sends a message as soon as a thief uses a stolen computer to log on to the Internet. This message contains the computer’s exact location and is directed to a tracking or monitoring center. Apple’s Find My iPhone system can be used to track missing iPhones, iPods, and iPads.
SURGE PROTECTION
Computers and peripheral devices require stable current and are particularly sensitive to sudden bursts of electrical energy. To ensure that your computer stays in good running condition, it is essential to protect it from power surges. A power surge is a sudden increase in electrical energy affecting the current that flows to electrical outlets. You can protect your computer equipment from power surges by plugging it into a surge suppressor, instead of directly into a wall outlet. For added protection during thunderstorms, shut down your computer, turn off all your peripheral devices, and unplug the surge suppressor and all computer-related cables from wall outlets, including the cable for your modem.
BASIC MAINTENANCE
To prevent hardware problems you can undertake some preventive maintenance to extend the life of your computer equipment. Regularly clean your computer components and peripheral devices to keep them in good condition.
A good computer maintenance routine:
• Back up your files regularly, particularly those that are most important to you. Test your back up procedures periodically.
• Run utilities that ensure peak performance for your hard disk drive.
• Delete your browser’s history and cache files on a monthly basis in order to free up space for your temporary files. The free space results in faster downloads from the Internet.
• Apply the latest operating system, driver, and security updates.
• Scan your computer for viruses and spyware once a week.
• Keep antivirus and spyware definitions updated.
To solve many hardware problems follow the basic guidelines for
troubleshooting:
• Stay calm and don’t jump to any conclusions until you’ve thought everything
through.
• Write down all error messages and any other information that goes with them. • Make sure all components are plugged in and that there are no loose cables.
• If you can, try to duplicate the problem by going through the same steps that
led you to it.
• Look for troubleshooting and repair tips in your user’s manual, on your
vendor’s Web site, or even through a search engine.
30

• Run your antispyware and antivirus software.
• Restarting your computer can clear up many minor operational problems.
Your computer probably has a special safe mode designed for professional troubleshooting. When operating in this mode, your computer uses a limited version of the operating system that allows you to use your mouse, screen, and keyboard, but no other peripheral devices.

TEXT A: SOFTWARE BASICS
The term software was once used for all non-hardware components of a computer. Using today’s terminology, however, the documents and photos you create are usually referred to as data files rather than as software. Software determines the tasks a digital device can help you accomplish. The instructions that tell a computer how to carry out a task are referred to as a computer program. These programs form the software that prepares a computer to do a specific task, such as document production, virus protection, file management, or Web browsing.
The two main categories are system software and application software. Operating systems are classified as system software. Device drivers, utilities, and programming languages are also system software. Application software categories include music, graphics, mapping, finance, and entertainment. Application software
   1)word processor, 2)spreadsheet, 3)virus protection, 4)browser, 5)photo editing, 6)database software, 7)email software, 8)presentation software, 9)music software, 10)video software, 11)mapping application, 12)drawing software
   a)Adobe Photoshop, b)Internet Explorer, c)Microsoft Word, d)Microsoft Excel, e)Microsoft PowerPoint, f)Kaspersky, g)Outlook Express, h)Oracle, i)iTunes, j)Apple iMovie, k)Google Maps, l)CorelDraw

is designed to help people accomplish real-world tasks, whereas system software is designed for computer-centric tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the applications you might have on your digital devices.
Music software offers many ways to work with music, sound effects, and narration from your desktop, laptop, or handheld computer. The most popular music software capabilities include downloading, playing and recording music files, creating playlists, transferring music to handheld devices, editing, cropping and mixing digital recordings, streaming, and identifying songs.
A mapping application displays satellite, aerial, or street maps used to locate places and get directions between two addresses. Google Maps is one of the most extensive mapping applications, and its core technology is the basis for many other mapping products. Location-based software is able to access your current location and use it to show you the closest shops, restaurants, ATMs, and theaters.
Business software is a broad term that includes vertical and horizontal market software. Vertical market software is designed to automate specialized tasks in a specific market or business. Examples include hospital patient management and billing software. Today, almost every business has access to some type of specialized vertical market software designed to automate, streamline, or computerize key business activities. Horizontal market software is generic software that just about any kind of business can use. For example, many small businesses use QuickBooks to keep track of income and expenses, pay bills, and track inventory. Payroll software and project management software are examples of horizontal market software.
A type of system software called utility software is designed to help you monitor and configure settings for your digital gear, its operating system, or application software. Like all system software, utilities focus on computer-centric tasks such as blocking viruses or diagnosing hard disk errors. A set of basic utilities is included with your device’s operating system. Third-party software companies offer additional products that extend and improve upon those supplied by the operating system. A PDF reader, such as Adobe Reader, is an essential utility that displays documents stored in standard PDF files.
Another popular category of utility software is system utilities that can track down and fix disk errors, repair corrupted files, and give your device a performance- enhancing tune-up. System utilities for handheld computers include apps which display memory usage, available storage space, CPU usage, Wi-Fi and cellular addresses, and battery level.
A device driver is software that helps a peripheral device establish communication with a computer. This type of system software is used by printers, monitors, sound cards, network cards, storage devices, modems, mice, and scanners. Once installed, a device driver automatically starts when it is needed. Device drivers usually run in the background, without opening a window on the screen.
Office suites, such as Microsoft Office and Google Docs, are popular with individual computer owners and in business environments. They are sometimes referred to as productivity software because they offer features that really help get
34

work done. An office suite is a collection of programs that typically include word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and database modules.
Word processing packages, such as Microsoft Word or iWork Pages give you the ability to create, spell-check, edit, and format a document on the screen before you commit it to paper. Your word processing software is likely to include a thesaurus, which can help you find a synonym for a word. A grammar checker reads through your document and points out potential grammatical trouble spots. Most word processing software includes a spelling checker that marks misspelled words in a document. The look of your final document depends on several formatting factors. Page layout refers to the physical position of each element on a page. Paragraph style includes the alignment of text within the margins and the space between each line of text. A font is a set of letters that share a unified design.
Spreadsheet software provides tools to create electronic spreadsheets. It is similar to a smart piece of paper that automatically adds up columns of numbers written on it. You can make other calculations, too, based on simple equations that you create or more complex, built-in formulas. It also includes special data-handling features that allow you to sort data, search for data that meets specific criteria, and print reports. Because it is so easy to experiment with different numbers, spreadsheet software is particularly useful for what-if analysis.
Database software helps you enter, find, organize, update, and report information stored in a database. Database software stores data as a series of records, which are composed of fields that hold data. A record holds data for a single entity – a person, place, thing, or event. A field holds one item of data relevant to a record. Many databases contain hundreds or thousands of records. If you want to find a particular record or a group of records, scrolling through every record would take a very long time. Instead, you can enter a query that describes the information you want to find. Queries can take several forms:
A query language, such as SQL (Structured Query Language), provides a set of commands for locating and manipulating data. A natural language query is a question stated in a language such as English, rather than an esoteric query language. A keyword search, popular with search engines such as Google, is simply a collection of words relevant to your search. A query by example (QBE) simply requires you to fill out a form with the type of data you want to locate.

TEXT B: INSTALLING AND BUYING SOFTWARE READING
Study the key words of the text below and try to define them in your own words.
a copyright, a handheld device, costly, a fee, free of charge, handy, a backup, original work, trial period, legal protection, a patent, a software upgrade
Software installation is the process of placing a program into a computer so that it can be run or executed. You can use some software without installing it, but other software has to be installed before you can use it. A Web application (or Web app) is software that is accessed with a Web browser. Instead of running locally,
    37

much of the program code for the software runs on a remote computer connected to the Internet or other computer network. Most Web apps require no installation at all on your local computer or handheld device. Your device must, however, have a Web browser and an Internet connection. Web apps are truly handy but consider their advantages and disadvantages:
+ You can access Web apps from any device that has a browser and an Internet connection. Your data is usually stored on the app's Web site, so you can access data even when you are away from your main computer. Web apps are always up to date. Web apps do not require local storage space.
 Web apps tend to have fewer features than applications that require installation. If the site hosting the app shuts down, you will not be able to access the application or your data. Your data might be more vulnerable to exposure or loss because it is out of your control. Make local backups, if possible.
A mobile app is designed for a handheld device, such as a smartphone, or tablet computer. Most handheld devices can use both Web apps and mobile apps. The difference between the two is that Web apps run on a remote computer, whereas mobile apps run from the handheld device, so they have to be downloaded and installed. Games and entertainment seem to dominate mobile apps, whereas shopping and social apps dominate the Web apps category.
Local applications are installed on a computer's hard disk. When you install a local application, all of its files are placed in the appropriate folders on your computer's hard disk, and then your computer performs any software or hardware configurations necessary to make sure the program is ready to run.
The main component of a software package is an executable file designed to be started by users or automatically launched by the operating system. Additional files contain support modules called «application extensions», data files, and text files.
Portable software is designed to run from removable storage, such as a CD or USB flash drive. Program files are not installed on the hard disk, no configuration data is stored on the hard disk, and no entries need to be made in the Windows Registry. When the device containing the portable software is removed from the computer, no trace of it is left there.
Periodically, software publishers replace older versions of a software product with a new version that’s sometimes referred to as a software upgrade. Upgrading to a new version usually involves a fee, but it is usually less costly than purchasing the new version off the shelf. A software update (sometimes called a software patch) is a small section of program code that replaces part of the software you currently have installed. The term service pack, which usually applies to operating system updates, is a set of updates. Updates and service packs are designed to correct problems and address security vulnerabilities. Software updates and service packs are usually free.
In most countries computer software is protected by a copyright. A copyright is a form of legal protection that grants the author of an original work an exclusive right to copy, distribute, sell, and modify that work. In addition to copyright
38

protection, computer software is often protected by the terms of a software license. A software license, or license agreement, is a legal contract that defines the ways in which you may use a computer program.
From a legal perspective, there are two categories of software: public domain and proprietary. Public domain software is not protected by copyright because the copyright has expired, or the author has placed the program in the public domain, making it available without restriction. Public domain software may be freely copied, distributed, and even resold. The primary restriction on public domain software is that you are not allowed to apply for a copyright on it. Proprietary software has restrictions on its use that are delineated by copyright, patents, or license agreements. Based on licensing rights, proprietary software is distributed as commercial software, demoware, shareware, freeware, and open source software.
Commercial software is usually sold in retail stores or at Web sites. Although you buy this software, you actually purchase only the right to use it under the terms of the software license. Some commercial software is free.
Demoware is distributed for free and often comes preinstalled on new computers, but it is limited in some way until you pay for it.
Shareware is copyrighted software marketed under a try-before-you-buy policy. To use it beyond the trial period, you are supposed to pay a registration fee. Unlike feature- or time-limited demoware, shareware is supposed to be fully- functioning software.
Open source software makes uncompiled program instructions – the source code – available to programmers who want to modify and improve the software. Open source software may be sold or distributed free of charge in compiled form, but it must, in every case, also include the source code. Linux is an example of open source software.
Freeware is copyrighted software that is available for free. It is fully functional and requires no payment for its use. A freeware license permits you to use the software, copy it, and give it away, but does not permit you to alter it or sell it. Many utility programs, most device drivers, and some games are available as freeware.
Before purchasing software, make sure the license allows you to use the software the way you want to. Just remember that many software programs exist and you can find usually alternatives with similar features offered under various licensing terms.

i. ... is a type of program that secretly gathers personal information without the
         41

 Security software is designed to protect computers from various forms of destructive software and unauthorized intrusions. Security software can be classified into various types: antivirus, antispyware, anti-spam, and firewalls. Each type focuses on a specific security threat. The terms malicious software and malware refer to any computer program designed to surreptitiously enter secretly a computer, gain unauthorized access to data, or disrupt normal processing operations. Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojans, bots, and spyware. Malware is created and unleashed by individuals referred to as hackers, crackers, black hats, or cybercriminals. Some malware is released as a prank. In an increasing number of cases, malware is unleashed for monetary gain.
A computer virus is a set of program instructions that attaches itself to a file, reproduces itself, and spreads to other files. A common misconception is that viruses spread themselves from one computer to another. They don’t. Viruses can replicate themselves only on the host computer. A key characteristic of viruses is their ability to lurk in a computer for days or months, quietly replicating themselves. While this replication takes place, you might not even know that your computer has contracted a virus; therefore, it is easy to inadvertently spread infected files to other people’s computers. In addition to replicating itself, a virus usually delivers a payload which can corrupt files, destroy data, or otherwise disrupt computer operations. A trigger event, such as a specific date, can unleash some viruses. Viruses that deliver their payloads on a specific date are sometimes referred to as time bombs.
Some malware does a good job of cloaking itself, so victims are unaware of its presence. Cloaking techniques are great defense mechanisms because when victims aren’t aware of malware, they won’t take steps to eradicate it. Some hackers cloak their work using rootkits. The term rootkit refers to software tools used to conceal malware and backdoors that have been installed on a victim’s computer. Rootkits are usually distributed by Trojans.
Some techniques for safe computing include installing and activating security software on any digital device that is at risk, keeping software patches and operating system service packs up to date, not opening suspicious e-mail attachments, obtaining software only from reliable resources and always scanning it for malware, avoiding unsavory Web sites and not clicking pop-up ads.
A security suite integrates several security modules to protect against the most common types of malware, unauthorized access, and spam. Security suites might include additional features such as Wi-Fi detection that warns of possible intrusions into your wireless network, and parental controls for monitoring and controlling children’s Internet usage. A security suite has both advantages and disadvantages. First, it costs less than purchasing standalone security modules. Second, a single interface for accessing all of the security suite’s features is much less complex than having to learn how to configure and run several different products. On the other
42

hand, most security suites cannot run concurrently with standalone security products, and overlapping security coverage from two similar products can cause glitches.
Antivirus software is a type of utility software that looks for and eradicates viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and bots. Some antivirus software also scans for spyware, although several security software publishers offer spyware detection as a separate module. Antivirus software is available for all types of computers and data storage devices, including handhelds, USB flash drives, servers, PCs, and Macs.
Modern antivirus software attempts to identify malware by searching your computer’s files and memory for virus signatures. A virus signature is a section of program code, such as a unique series of instructions that can be used to identify a known malicious program, much as a fingerprint is used to identify an individual. Antivirus software scans for virus signatures in programs, data files, incoming and outgoing e-mail and attachments.
Two aspects of your antivirus software periodically need to be updated. First, the antivirus program itself might need a patch or an update to fix bugs or improve features. Second, the list of virus signatures must be updated to keep up with the latest malware developments. Virus signatures and other information that antivirus software uses to identify and eradicate malware are stored in one or more files usually referred to as virus definitions (or a virus database). If, during the scanning process, your virus protection software identifies a virus, worm, or Trojan horse in a file, it can try to remove the infection, put the file into quarantine, or simply delete the file. A quarantined file contains code that is suspected of being part of a virus. For your protection, most antivirus software encrypts the file’s contents and isolates it in a quarantine folder, so it can’t be inadvertently opened or accessed by a hacker.
Despite occasional misses, however, antivirus software and other security software modules are constantly weeding out malware that would otherwise infect your computer. It is essential to use security software, but also important to take additional precautions, such as making regular backups of your data.

TEXT A: OPERATING SYSTEM BASICS
An operating system (abbreviated OS) is a type of system software that acts as the master controller for all activities that take place within a computer system. Your computer’s OS provides an environment for running software and controlling peripheral devices. While you interact with application software, your computer’s OS is busy behind the scenes with resource (any component that is required to perform work) management tasks such as:
- Manage processor resources to handle simultaneous input, output, and processing tasks. Many activities – called processes – compete for the attention of your computer’s microprocessor. To manage all these competing processes, your computer’s OS must ensure that each process receives its share of microprocessor cycles. Depending on the capabilities of the OS and computer hardware, processes can be managed by multitasking (provides process and memory management services that allow two or more tasks, jobs, or programs to run simultaneously), multithreading (allows multiple parts, or threads to run simultaneously), and multiprocessing (supports a division of labor among all the processing units).
- Manage memory by allocating space for all the programs and data that are in use during a computing session. Sometimes an application requests memory but never releases it- a condition called a memory leak. Memory «leaks» away into
  46

this application’s reserved area, eventually preventing other programs from accessing enough memory to function properly.
- Keep track of storage resources so that files and programs can be found and manipulated. OS stores and retrieves files from your computer’s hard drive and other storage devices. It remembers the names and locations of all your files and keeps track of empty spaces where new files can be stored.
- Ensure that input and output proceed in an orderly manner by communicating with peripheral devices. Your computer’s OS communicates with device driver software so that data can travel smoothly between the computer and peripheral resources. It uses buffers to collect and hold data while the computer is busy with other tasks.
For most computers, the operating system program is quite large, so most of it is stored on a hard disk. During the boot process, the operating system kernel is loaded into RAM. The kernel provides essential OS services, such as memory management and file access. The kernel stays in RAM all the time your computer is on. Other parts of the OS, such as customization utilities, are loaded into RAM as they are needed.
The sequence of events that occurs between the time that you turn on a computer and the time that it is ready for you to issue commands is referred to as the boot process, or booting your computer. Your computer’s small bootstrap program is built into special ROM circuitry housed in the computer’s system unit. When you turn on a computer, the ROM circuitry receives power and begins the boot process by executing the bootstrap program.
- Establish basic elements of the user interface such as appearance of the desktop, menus, and toolbars. A user interface can be defined as the combination of hardware and software that helps people and computers communicate with each other. Most computers today feature a graphical user interface, abbreviated as GUI and pronounced as «gooey» or «gee you eye». There are some basic control elements of a GUI. A desktop is a visual work area that covers the entire screen and remains in the background throughout a computing session. A desktop includes a taskbar or dock for launching applications, which are displayed in rectangular application windows on the desktop. A Start screen, popular on handheld devices, appears at the end of the boot process and whenever it is invoked by the user, commonly by pressing the Home button. Start screens display icons or titles for apps. An icon is a small picture that represents a program, file, or hardware device. Some icons are designed as tiles, which can display information feeds of live data. A button is a graphic that can be clicked to make a selection. They can be arranged in a toolbar or displayed on a taskbar. A menu displays a list of commands or options on a menu bar. A ribbon is an alternative type of menu that is arranged as rows of tools on a succession of tabs. Two methods are generally used to present a reasonably sized list of options: submenus and dialog boxes. A submenus is an additional set of commands that the computer displays after you make a selection from the main menu. A dialog box displays the options associated with a command. You fill in the dialog box to indicate specifically how you want the command carried out.

One OS might be better suited to some computing tasks than others. To provide clues to their strengths and weaknesses, operating systems are informally categorized and characterized using one or more of the following terms:
A single-user operating system deals with one set of input devices – those that can be controlled by one user at a time. Operating systems for tablet computers and smartphones fit into this category. DOS is an example of a single-user OS designed for desktop computers.
A multiuser operating system allows a single, centralized computer to deal with simultaneous input, output, and processing requests from many users. One of the most difficult responsibilities is to schedule all the processing requests that a centralized computer must perform.
A server operating system provides tools for managing distributed networks, e-mail servers, and Web hosting sites. Server OSs typically route data and programs to each user’s local computer where the actual processing takes place. They might also provide multiuser capabilities.
A desktop operating system is designed for a desktop or laptop personal computer. These operating systems are designed to accommodate one user at a time, but also provide networking capability.
A mobile operating system is designed for devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Mobile OSs support touchscreens, but tend to limit multitasking and user access to local storage devices.

TEXT B: FILE BASICS AND FILE MANAGEMENT ACTIVE VOCABULARY
Study the key terms of this unit and try to define them in your own words.
defragmentation utility, fragmented files, formatting process, a track, a sector, a cluster, a file header, a file format, file specification, a folder, reserved words
READING
Read the text and find answers to the questions:
1. Is the file extension the same as a file format? What the significance of file format? 2. How can you manage files on a computer?
3. What do you know about physical file storage?
Computer files in digital format offer a compact and convenient way to store documents, photos, videos, and music. They have several characteristics, such as a name, format, location, size, and date. Every file has a name and might also have a file extension. When you save a file, you must provide a valid file name that adheres to specific rules, referred to as file-naming conventions. Each OS has a unique set of file-naming conventions. A file extension is an optional file identifier that is separated from the main file name by a period. Some OSs also contain a list of reserved words that are used as commands or special identifiers. To designate a file’s location, you must first specify the device where the file is stored. You can store files on a hard drive, removable storage, a network computer, or cloud-based storage (Internet-based storage service). Every storage device has a directory containing a list of its files. The main directory is referred to as the root directory. A root directory can be subdivided into smaller lists. Each list is called a subdirectory.
  50

Each subdirectory is depicted as a folder. Folders help you envision your files as if they were stored in a filing cabinet.
A computer file’s location is defined by a file specification, sometimes called a path (C:\Music\Reggae\Marley One Love.mp3), which on a PC includes the drive letter, folder(s), file name, and extension. The term file format refers to the organization and layout of data that is stored in a file. The format of a file usually includes a header, data, and possibly an end-of-file marker. A file header is a section of data at the beginning of a file that contains information about a file, such as the date it was created, the date it was last update, its size, and its file type.
A file extension is not the same as a file format. Although a file extension is a good indicator of a file’s format, it doesn’t really define the format. A software application can open files that exist in its native file format, plus several additional file formats. But when a file doesn’t open, one of the three things probably went wrong:
1. The file might have been damaged by a transmission or disk error. Although you might be able to use file recovery software to repair the damage.
2. Someone might have inadvertently changed the file extension. If you have a little time, you change the file extension and try to open the file. Otherwise, you should contact the source of the file to get accurate information about its real format.
3. Some file formats exist in several variations. You might be able to open the file if you use different application software.
Perhaps you need to convert a file from one format to another. The easiest way to do it is to find application software that works with both file formats. Open the file using that software, and then use the Export option, or the Save As dialog box, to select a new file format, assign the file a new name, and save it
Before a computer can store a file on a disk, CD, DVD, or BD, the storage medium must be formatted. The formatting process creates the equivalent of electronic storage bins by dividing a disk into tracks and then further dividing each track into sectors. Tracks and sectors are numbered to provide addresses for each data storage bin. On hard disks, tracks are arranged as concentric circles; on CDs, DVDs, and BDs, one or more tracks spiral out from the centre of the disk.
The OS uses a file system to keep track of the names and locations of files that reside on a storage medium, such as a hard disk. To speed up the process of storing and retrieving data, a disk drive usually works with a group of sectors called a cluster or a block.
When you save a file, your PC’s OS looks at the index file to see which clusters are empty. It selects one of these empty clusters, records the file data there, and then revises the index file to include the new file name and its location.
A file that does not fit into a single cluster spills over into the next contiguous (meaning adjacent) cluster, unless that cluster already contains data. When contiguous clusters are not available, the OS stores parts of a file in noncontiguous (nonadjacent) clusters.
When you want to retrieve a file, the OS looks through the index for the file name and its location. It moves the disk drive’s read-write head to the first cluster
51

that contains the file data. Using additional data from the index file, the OS can move the read-write heads to each of the clusters containing the remaining parts of the file.
As a computer writes files on a disk, parts of files tend to become scattered all over the disk. These fragmented files are stored in noncontiguous clusters. Drive performance generally declines as the read-write heads move back and forth to locate the clusters containing the parts of a file. To regain peak performance, you can use a defragmentation utility, such as Windows Disk Defragmenter, to arrange the files on a disk so that they are stored in contiguous clusters.

READING
Read the text and find the answers to the questions.
1. Why do I need to make backups?
2. What are the major strategies and plans of backups? 3. What does their choice depend on?
4. What backup would you prefer? Why?
You can’t always prevent data disasters, so you should have a backup that stores the files needed to recover data that’s been wiped out by operator error, viruses, or hardware failures. Your backup schedule depends on how much data you can afford to lose. If you want to be able to restore your computer to its current state, you need to backup all of its files using synchronization software, backup software, imaging software, or virtual machine technology.
Synchronization compares the content of files on two devices and makes them the same. It can be used for backup because it dynamically maintains a parallel set of files on your computer’s hard disk and your backup device.
A program called Time Machine supplied with Mac OS X is a good example of synchronization software. It works by first making a backup of every file from the computer’s primary storage device and synchronizes any files that have been changed. Windows includes a synchronization utility called File History. It is designed to back up files stored in your Libraries, Desktop, Favorites, and Contacts folders. Once you activate File History, it checks hourly for files that have changed and copies those files to the backup device.
A full system backup includes a copy of every file stored on your computer’s hard drive. In addition to data files, a full system backup includes copies of all installed programs, settings, and the OS. To restore your hard drive, you’ll need to use a boot disk, a recovery disk, and copies of your application software. A boot disk is a removable storage medium containing the OS files needed to boot your computer without accessing the hard disk. CDs, DVDs, and even USB flash drives can be used as boot disks. A recovery disk is a bootable CD, DVD, or other media that contains a complete copy of your computer’s hard disk as it existed when the computer was new. It contains the OS, device drivers, utilities, and even software that was bundled with your computer. However, a recovery disk will not restore your data files, any software that you installed, or any configuration settings you’ve made since you unwrapped your computer from its shipping box.
54

Recovery partitions are convenient for restoring a corrupted device driver or software module because you can simply copy or reinstall the file from the recovery partition to the main partition. The files in the recovery partition are not accessible, however, if your computer’s hard disk fails.
The Windows Registry is an important group of files to store configuration information about all the devices and software installed on a computer system. But backing up the Registry can be a problem because the Registry is always open while your computer is on. Some software that you might use for backups cannot copy open files. To get periodic copies of your computer’s Registry settings, you can create restore points. A restore point is a snapshot of your computer settings. Restore points can be set by accessing the Control Panel and then searching for “Restore Point”. If a hard disk problem causes system instability, you might be able to roll back to a restore point when your computer was operational.
Backup software is a set of utility programs designed to back up and restore some or all of the files on a computer’s primary storage device. Backup software differs from most copy and synchronization routines because it compresses all the files for a backup and places them in one large file. The backup file is indexed so that individual files can be located, uncompressed, and restored. A differential backup makes a backup of only those files that were added or changed since your last full backup session.
An incremental backup backs up files that were added or changed since the last backup. To restore a set of incremental backups, you must first install a full backup, then install each of the incremental in succession. Remember, you should run an up-to-date virus check as the first step in your backup routine.
Some backup systems streamline the process by restoring a computer’s OS, device drivers, settings, and data in a single step – a process called bare-metal restore. Bare-metal restore software usually works with a disk image. A disk image is a bit-by-bit copy of the data from all sectors of a disk. Disk imaging utilities create an exact clone of the original disk, unlike most backup software that makes file-by- file copies. A disk image includes all the data from a disk, even boot information and other data locked by the OS. But it copies data from the entire disk; it generally cannot be configured like traditional backup software to copy only selected files.
Today’s trend toward the use of virtual machines offers another option for backups. For example, if you run Windows as a virtual machine on a Mac, you can simply back up the entire Windows machine as one folder or file.
Handheld devices are usually backed up by synching them to a desktop or laptop computer.
Many Android devices include backup software, usually accessible from the Settings icon. Generally, backups from Android devices are stored in the cloud on Google servers. If you want to go beyond data backup and back up your Android system files, you can use third-party backup software, such as Titanium Backup or Backup Master.

TEXT A: COMPUTER NETWORKS
Today, networks are everywhere and everyone wants to be connected. Networks can be classified according to their size and geographic scope (PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN). You can think of a network as a spider web with many interconnecting points, referred to as node. A network node usually contains a computer, networked peripheral, or network device. To connect to a LAN, a computer requires network circuitry, sometimes referred to as a network interface card (NIC). Network circuitry is built into the main system board of most personal computers. If not, a NIC can be added to a slot in the system board or a USB port.
A networked peripheral is any device that contains network circuitry to directly connect to a network. Printers, scanners, and storage devices are examples of devices that can be equipped to directly connect to a network instead of connecting to a workstation.
A storage device that directly connects to a network is called network attached storage (NAS). A network device is any electronic device that broadcasts network data, boosts signals, or routes data to its destination. The most important network device is a router, which acts as a central distribution point for getting data to its destination. Network devices also include hubs, switches, gateways, bridges, wireless access points, and repeaters.
Data in a network with wired connections travels from one device to another over cables. Wired connections are fast, secure and simple to configure. This type of connection is more secure than wireless one because a computer can only join a network if it is physically connected by a cable. An example of wired network technology is Ethernet.
 59
Ethernet is a family of a computer networking technologies
 commonly used in LAN, MAN and WAN.

A network without wires transports data through the air, eliminating the need for cables. Networks of all sizes, from PANs to LANs and WANs, can use wireless technologies, such as radio signals, microwaves, and infrared light. Most wireless connections transport data as RF signals (radio frequency signals). They are sent and received by a transceiver (a combination of a transmitter and a receiver) that is equipped with an antenna. Workstations, peripheral devices and network devices can be equipped with transceivers.
Microwaves (the waves themselves, not your oven) can be aimed in a single direction and have more carrying capacity than radio waves. Microwave installations usually provide data transport for large corporate networks.
Today, most people are familiar with television remote controls that use infrared light beams. Infrared can also carry data signals, but only for short distances and with a clear line of sight. Its most practical use seems to be for transmitting data between devices connected to a PAN.
The most popular wireless LAN technology is WI-FI. WI-FI refers to a set of wireless networking technologies defined by IEEE802.11 standards. A WI-FI device transmits data as radio waves and is compatible with Ethernet, so you can use the two technologies in a single network. Additional wireless technology is Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a short-range wireless network technology that is designed to make connections between two devices. A communications channel or link, is a physical path or a frequency for signal transmissions.
Network links must move data and move it quickly. Bandwidth is the transmission capacity of a communications channel. High-bandwidth communications systems, such as a cable TV and DSL, are referred to as broadband, whereas systems with less capacity, such as dial-up Internet access, are referred to as narrowband. Broadband capacity is essential for networks that support many users, and those that carry lots of audio and video data, such as music and movie downloads.
A communication protocol refers to a set of rules for efficiently transmitting data from one network node to another. Protocols set standards for encoding and decoding data, guiding data to its destination. Specifically, protocols are responsible for the following aspects of network communications: dividing messages into packets, affording addresses to packets, initiating transmission, regulating the flow of data, checking for transmission errors, acknowledging receipts of transmitted data.
A packet is a parcel of data that is sent across a computer network. Each packet contains the address of a sender, the destination address, a sequence number, and some data. Some communications networks, such as the telephone system, use a technology called circuit switching, which essentially establishes a dedicated, private link between one telephone and another for the duration of a call. Unfortunately, circuit switching is rather inefficient. For example, when someone is on hold, no communication is taking place - yet the circuit is reserved and cannot be used for other communications. A more efficient alternative to circuit switching is packet switching technology, which divides a message into several packets that can be routed independently to their destination. Every packet includes the address of its
60

destination device. Packets from many different messages can share a single communications channel. When data reaches its destination, it is checked for errors one last time and then the packets are reassembled into their original configurations.

The internet backbone is a network of high-capacity routers and fiber-optic
links that provides the main routes for data traffic across the internet. Backbone links and routers are maintained by network service providers (NSPs). NSP equipment and links are tied together by network access points (NAPs). An internet service provider (ISP) is a company that offers Internet access to individuals, businesses, and smaller ISPs. To communicate with an ISP, your computer uses some type of communications device, such as modem. A modem contains circuitry that converts the data-carrying signals from your computer to signals that can travel over various communications channels. Data travels over the internet at an incredible speed. On average, data usually arrives at its destination in less than a second after it is sent.
The elapsed time for data to make a round trip from point A to point B and back to point A is referred to as latency. The utility called Ping (Packet Internet Groper) sends a signal to a specific Internet address and waits for a reply. When a reply arrives, Ping reports that computer is online and displays the elapsed time for the round- trip message. Another utility called Traceroute records a path of packet in addition to its round-trip speed. You can use Traceroute to analyze the latency of your data as it hops from one router to the next. The connection speeds advertised by ISPs refer to the amount of data that travels between a computer of subscriber and ISP within a given time period. Your connection speed depends on whether you connect to your ISP using a telephone, cable television, satellite, or wireless link. Actual speed can differ from maximum speed because links are susceptible to interference that can hinder signals. Upstream speed can also differ from downstream speed. Upstream speed is the rate of data that is uploaded from one computer to the Internet. Downstream speed is the rate of data downloaded to your computer. When upstream speeds differ from downstream speeds, you have an asymmetric Internet connection. When upstream and downstream are the same, you have a symmetric
63

Internet connection. For most users, however, an asymmetric connection is sufficient.
Consumers have several options for connecting to the Internet. Fixed Internet access links your computer to an ISP from a stationary point, such as wall socket or roof-mounted antenna. Portable Internet access allows you to easily move your access device, as in the case of vehicle-mounted satellite dishes that can be deployed when the vehicle is parked. It is light and compact enough to easily carry. Like a fixed satellite dish, a portable dish transmits signals to and receives signals from a geostationary satellite. Mobile Internet access allows you to use Internet as you are on the go, such as using a cell phone to collect your e-mail while you are traveling by train. You are not necessarily limited to a single Internet access option. Many consumers find it convenient to maintain fixed Internet access for home use, but use portable or mobile method of Internet access while out.
A dial-up connection is a fixed Internet connection that uses a voiceband modem and telephone lines to transport data between your computer and your ISP. DSL (digital subscriber line) is a high- speed, digital, always-on Internet access technology that runs over standard phone lines. It is one of the fastest Internet connections that is affordable to individual consumers. DSL data is transmitted to and from your local telephone switching station in pure digital form and can simultaneously carry voice and data. The speed of a DSL connection varies according the characteristics of your telephone line and your distance from the switching station. Cable Internet service is a means of distributing always-on broadband Internet access over the same infrastructure that offers cable television service. Cable signals are not particularly vulnerable to environmental interference but data transport speeds are affected by subscriber use. The cable you share with your neighbors has a certain amount of bandwidth. The more and more neighbors use the service, it might seem to get slower and slower. Most people are familiar with services that provide also Internet access. Satellite Internet service is a means of distributing always-on, high-speed asymmetric Internet access by broadcasting signals to and from a personal satellite dish. Satellite signals access to television programming over a personal satellite dish. Many companies that provide satellite TV can be blocked or slowed by adverse weather conditions, such as rain and snow, which makes this type of data transport less reliable than cable and DSL.
In addition to being popular for home networks, WI-FI is also used for public networks operated by merchants, hotels, schools, and municipalities. If your computer is equipped for WI-FI, as are most of laptops, tablets, and smartphones, you have a portable means of accessing the Internet by carrying your digital device to any WI-FI hotspot. WI-FI hotspot is an area in which the public can access a WI-FI network that offers Internet service. Some WI-FI hotspots offer free service that might or might not require a password, others require a service plan or one-time use free. The speed of a hotspot is related to the speed of the wired line that connects it to the Internet.
There is a lot of buzz about cloud computing these days, and its scope continues to evolve. Cloud computing is a concept, it is the idea that consumers use
64

their computers or handheld devices to access applications, storage, and other computing resources supplied by Internet-based servers, rather than from their local devices. Cloud computing encompasses most Internet-enabled activities including Webmail, Google searching, social networking, blogging and photo sharing. The concept of cloud computing is that apps and data are available any time, from anywhere, and on any device. Cloud computing depends on a grid of servers, storage devices, and protocols that offer Internet-accessible computing ranging from consumer-level media sharing to office productivity applications and complex corporate data processing. These resources are maintained by Internet service companies, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. For example, Apple maintains a 500.000-square-foot facility for its iCloud data center where subscribers can store music, photos, data files, backups, reminders and contracts. Microsoft offers a similar cloud service called SkyDrive.

case of a hard drive failure and computers should be protected by antivirus software. Wireless signals are broadcasted through the air, and like the signals from a radio station, they can be picked up by any device equipped with a receiver tuned to the right frequency. Wired connections funnel data through a cable, not through the air. Wired signals can be intercepted only by physically tapping into the cable or router.
If your network is not secured, hackers can easily connect to it, monitor transmitted data, access connected devices, spread viruses, and use your network as a launching pad for spam.
Encryption transforms a message in such a way that its contents are hidden from unauthorized readers. Encryption is designed to keep messages secret. In the context of computing, encryption can be used in many ways, including the following:
 Scrambling data sent over wired or wireless networks to prevent intrusions.
 Securing credit card numbers and other personal information transferred from shoppers’ computers to e-commerce sites.
 Encrypting computer files and databases so that data they contain is unusable if the device containing the data is lost or compromised.
 Scrambling the contents of e-mail messages to maintain privacy.
Symmetric key encryption uses the key to encrypt a message as well as decrypt it. Symmetric keys are not practical for e-mail and other situations in which the person receiving encrypted data does not have the key beforehand.
Public key encryption eliminates the key-distribution problem by using one key to encrypt a message, but another key to decrypt the message. Public key encryption is a crucial technology for e-commerce and e-mail. When you use a secure connection to transmit a credit card number, the server sends a public key to your browser. Your browser uses this public key to encrypt the credit card number. After it is encrypted, no one – not even you – can use the public key to decrypt the message. The encrypted message is sent to a Web server, where the private key is used to decrypt it.
An intrusion is any access to data or programs by hackers, criminals, or other unauthorized persons. As the result of an intrusion, data can be stolen or altered, system configurations can be changed to allow even more intrusions, and software can be surreptitiously installed and operated under the remote control of a hacker. One of the most common ways of gaining unauthorized access to a network-based computer is by looking for open ports. A communications port is the doorway that allows a computer to exchange data with other devices. It is a portal through which data flows. A port probe (or port scan) is the use of automated software to locate computers that have open ports and are vulnerable to unauthorized access. One of the easiest steps to enhance your security is to turn it off when you are not using it. When your computer is turned off, its ports are inactive and they are not vulnerable to intrusions. Putting your computer into sleep mode or activating a screensaver is not sufficient protection. Your computer must be shut down and turned off. You should also keep your computer up to date with the latest operating system security patches and service packs.
67

A firewall is software or hardware designed to filter out suspicious packets attempting to enter or leave a computer. Firewall software helps keep your computer secure in several ways. It ensures that incoming information was actually requested and is not an unauthorized intrusion. It blocks activity from suspicious IP addresses and – best of all – it reports intrusion attempts so that you can discover whether hackers are trying to break into your computer.
One of the most effective steps you can take to secure your computer from intrusions is to install a router. It screens IP addresses to keep locally addressed packets within the LAN so that they are delivered without traveling a circuitous route over the Internet and back. Your router has its own IP address. The key point about your IP address is that it is routable. A routable IP address is one that can be accessed by packets on the Internet. When you connect your PC to a router and request an IP address, your router answers your request, not the ISP. Most routers are configured to assign private IP addresses. A private IP address is non-routable IP address that can be used within a LAN, but not for Internet data transport. Network address translation (NAT) is the process your router uses to keep track of packets and their corresponding private or public IP addresses. Sales representatives and telecommuters often access corporate networks from home by using a secured connection called a virtual private network.

TEXT A: INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS ANALYSIS
Most organizations use information systems to operate more effectively, gather information, and accomplish tasks. In this section, the term information system refers to a system that uses computers and usually includes communications networks. An information system collects, stores, and processes data to provide useful, accurate, and timely information. Today most information systems rely on computers and communications networks to store, process, and transmit information with far more efficiency than would be possible using manual systems. Every organization has its mission and all activities that take place in an organization, including those that involve computers, should contribute to this mission. One of the major functions of any information system is to help people make decisions in response to problems.
An information system progresses through several phases as it is developed, used, and finally retired. These phases encompass a system development life cycle, usually referred to as the SDLC known as System Development Life Cycle, which provides a general outline of how an information system evolves and delineates the phases of system development. Systems analysis and design is a discipline that focuses on developing information systems according to the phases of an SDLC.
The Planning phase for an information system project includes the following activities: assemble the project team, justify the project, choose the development methodology, develop a project schedule, produce a project development plan.
The goal of these activities is to create a Project Development Plan. The Project Development Plan is usually reviewed and approved by management. This planning document includes:
 A short description of the project, including its scope;
 A justification for the project, which includes an estimate of the project costs and potential financial benefits;
 A list of project team participants; 71

 A schedule for the project, including an outline of its phases.
Depending on the scope of the problem and the expertise of the professional staff, an information systems project can be managed by an in-house information technology department or outsourced to a development firm. A system development project team is assigned to analyze and develop an information system. Other members of an organization might also be asked to participate in various phases of the project.
Justifying a project often involves identifying problems and opportunities within an organization’s current information system. Project team members can identify problems and opportunities using a variety of techniques, such as interviews and data analysis. As part of the planning phase, the project team selects one or more methodologies that provide structure for the development effort. A system development methodology guides developers through the phases of system development and specifies what takes place in each phase; it encompasses the activities, procedures, methods, best practices, deliverables, and automated tools that system developers follow to complete the SDLC. The next activity is project scheduling. It begins in the planning phase, but stretches throughout the entire project. Project managers organize the work into tasks and milestones, which can be scheduled and assigned. As tasks are completed, the schedule is updated and adjusted. Project management software is assigned to help in planning and scheduling. It helps managers track and visualize the complex interactions between tasks. Popular project management offerings include open source software such as Open Workbench, and commercial software such as Microsoft Project. Industry standard tools for scheduling and project management include: PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is a method for analyzing the time needed to complete each project task and identifying the minimum time needed to complete the total project. A (work breakdown structure) breaks a complex task into a series of subtasks. A uses bars to show the timing of development tasks as they occur over time. Each bar on the chart represents a task; the length of a bar indicates the task’s expected duration.
The Analysis phase begins after the project team selects a development methodology, draws up the Project Plan, and receives permission to proceed from management. The goal of the analysis phase is to produce a list of requirements for a new or revised information system. Activities for analysis phase are: study the current system, determine the system requirements, and write requirements report. The project team determines requirements by interviewing users and studying successful information systems that solve similar problems. Another way to determine requirements is to construct a prototype. A systems analyst shows the prototype to users, who evaluate which features of the prototype are important for the new information system. Most new information systems are designed to replace a system or process that is already in place. It is important to study the current system to understand its strengths and weaknesses before designing a new system. After the project team studies the current system and then determines what the new system
 WBS
 Gantt chart
72

should do, system requirements are incorporated into a document called a System Requirements Report that describes the objectives for an information system. System requirements are the criteria for successfully solving problems identified in an information system. A new or updated information system should meet requirements defined by the project team. A CASE tool (computer-aided software engineering tool) is a software application designed for documenting system requirements, diagramming current and proposed information systems, scheduling development tasks, and developing computer programs.

TEXT B: SYSTEM DESIGN. IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE READING
Study the possible software alternatives and work out their «pros» and «cons».
    1. Creating an information system from scratch with programming tools using a programming language can take many months or years. It is usually costly, but offers the most flexibility for meeting the system requirements.
2. An application development tool is essentially a type of software construction kit containing building blocks that can be assembled into a software product. Expert
 74

   system shells and database management systems are included. It usually speeds up the development process, but might not offer the same level of flexibility as a programming language.
3. Application software for an information system is usually a series of preprogrammed software modules supplied by a software developer. It eliminates much of the design work required with programming languages or application development tools. Although most application software has some customization options, in many cases, it cannot be modified to exactly meet every system requirement, which necessitates adjustments in an organization’s procedures.
4. A turnkey system is essentially an “information system in a box,” which consists of hardware and application software designed to offer a complete information system solution. It might seem like a quick and easy solution, and it looks attractive to many project teams. However, it must be extensively evaluated to determine whether it can satisfy system requirements.
 So, if in the Analysis phase, the project team determines what the new information system must do, in the Design phase the project team must figure out how the new system will fulfill the requirements specified in the System Requirements Report. The project team chooses a solution, selects hardware and software, and designs detailed application specifications. There might be more than one way to solve the problems and meet the requirements identified in the analysis phase of the SDLC. Some potential solutions might be better than others, more effective, less costly, or less complex. The basis for choosing hardware and software includes general criteria, such as cost and delivery time. The project team should also consider the vendor’s reliability, expertise, and financial stability. A request for proposal (RFP) is a document that describes the information system problem and the requirements for the solution. An RFP essentially asks a vendor to recommend hardware and software for the solution, and to describe the vendor’s qualifications for implementing the solution. A request for quotation (RFQ) is a request for a formal price quotation on a list of hardware and software. A project team issues an RFQ to vendors when it knows the make and model of the equipment and the titles of the software packages needed but wants to compare prices from different vendors. Technical criteria for hardware might include processing speed, reliability, upgradability, maintenance costs, and warranty. Technical criteria for software might include reliability, compatibility, and the availability of patches to fix program errors. The project team has to consider the overall architecture based on level of automation, processing methodology, and network technology. Software alternatives might also be considered. Exactly what happens next in the system design phase depends on the type of solution selected. If a turnkey solution is selected, the next step might be to get approval to move into the implementation phase of the SDLC. In contrast, if the project team selects a solution that requires custom programming, the team’s systems analysts will create a set of application specifications that describe the way the information system’s software should interact with users, store data, process
75

data, and format reports. But the last step in this stage is to write application specifications. This is a key element in developing an effective information system and play a critical role in ensuring that the development process proceeds efficiently.
During the Implementation phase of the SDLC, the project team supervises the tasks necessary to construct the new information system. The tasks that take place during the implementation phase can include: purchase and install hardware and/or software, create applications, test applications, finalize documentation, train users, convert data, convert to new system.
As the implementation phase begins, programming languages, development tools, and application software needed for the new information system are purchased, installed, and tested to ensure that they work correctly. Software testing can reveal problems that result from incompatibilities with existing hardware and software. These problems must be corrected before continuing with system development. Testing might also reveal bugs (errors) in the software, which must be corrected by the software developer. In addition to new software, the specifications for most new information systems require new hardware, which can either replace old equipment or supplement existing equipment. When the software for an information system is created by using a programming language or an application development tool, programmers must create and test all the new software modules. When an information system is constructed using application software, the software sometimes must be customized. Software customization is the process of modifying a commercial application to reflect an organization’s needs. Customization might include modifying the user interface, enabling various security settings, selecting the menus that appear on the screen, and designing forms or reports. A rigorous testing process is the only way to make sure a new information system works. Different types of testing during the implementation phase help identify and fix problems before the information system is incorporated into day-to-day business activities. One of the most important tasks during the implementation phase is to make sure the information system is completely documented so that it can be used effectively and modified easily. The documentation for an information system can be broadly categorized as system documentation or user documentation. System documentation describes a system’s features, hardware architecture, and programming. User documentation describes how to interact with the system to accomplish specific tasks. It might also include tutorials that demonstrate how to get started and how to accomplish specific tasks. In preparation for using a new information system, users generally need training on software use and data entry. During training sessions, users learn how to interact with the interface, use the new system to perform day-to- day tasks, and find additional information in user manuals, procedure handbooks, or video tutorials. Training sessions for a new information system can be conducted by members of the project team or outsourced to professional trainers. The old data must also be loaded into the new system – a process called data conversion. System conversion refers to the process of deactivating an old information system and activating a new one. It is also referred to as a «cutover» or «to go live». When converting data from an existing computer system to a new system, a programmer
76

can write conversion software to read the old data and convert it into a format that is usable by the new system. Without such software, users would be forced to manually reenter data from the old system into the new system.
The Maintenance phase is the last and the longest SDLC phase and it lasts until the system is retired. It involves day-to-day operation of the system, making modifications to improve performance, and correcting problems. Three key concepts ensure good quality of maintenance service: reliability, availability, and serviceability. The term quality of service (QOS) refers to the level of performance a computer system provides. Typical maintenance phase activities ensure that the system functions as well as possible. During the maintenance phase, an information system is likely to undergo many changes to meet an organization’s needs. Changes can include: operating system, application software and security upgrades, user interface revisions to make the system easier to use, application software revisions to fix bugs and add features, hardware replacements necessary to retire defective equipment or enhance performance, hardware, software, or network adjustments to maintain and enhance quality of service. Although the analysis, design, and implementation phases of the SDLC are costly, for many organizations, the maintenance phase is the most expensive because it is the longest. When an information system first goes alive, maintenance costs are high while programmers work out bugs and users clamor for suggest. After most of the bugs are fixed and users become familiar with the information system, maintenance costs decrease. As an information system near the end of its useful life span, repair costs rise, and changing business practices begin to require modifications that time-consuming and expensive to implement.

TEXT C: INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA SECURITY READING
Read the text and find the answers to the questions.
Threats against information systems are increasing. As with personal computers, common threats to corporate information systems include natural disas- ters, power outages, equipment failures, human errors, software failures, security breaches, acts of war, and malware. Threats to a corporate information system can affect thousands of people. Natural disasters can completely shut down a computer system, cut off service to customers, and potentially destroy the system completely. Power outages can be caused by natural disasters, overloaded power grids, planned brownouts, and rolling blackouts. Equipment failures can occur in any hardware component of a computer system. The risk of failures increases as a hardware component ages, but they can occur in brand-new hardware. Human errors are mistakes made by computer operators, for example, entering inaccurate data and failing to follow required procedures. Software failures can be caused by bugs or flawed software design. Flaws in critical software that controls air traffic or nuclear power plants can be deadly. Other bugs may cause security leaks that allow unauthorized access to corporate servers. Security breaches include stolen data, physical intrusions, and deliberate sabotage. Cyberterrorism can cause damage to critical national infrastructures such as power grids and telecommunications systems. Malware can damage just about any computer system. You might have experienced the nuisance of rooting out a virus from your personal computer. With the escalation of online crime, corporate identity theft has become a major security threat. When a company’s brand is used without authorization, the company has become a victim of identity theft. Corporate identity attacks can undermine customer confidence, overwhelm customer service, generate bad publicity and result in lost revenues. The Internet makes it easy to steal corporate identities and use them for phishing scams and fake Web sites. It is not difficult for hackers to copy logos and other graphic elements from Web pages of legitimate sites and compile them into an official-looking e-mail message. Creating a fake Web site is also easy. Hackers can obtain a URL that's similar to one used by a legitimate company by using a different country code or using .biz instead of .com. By copying and pasting a few
 1. What are the most common threats to the data stored on corporate information
 systems?
 2. What is corporate identity theft? How are corporate identities stolen?
 3. How is the data on corporate information systems protected from threats?
 4. Does a data center help minimize risks? What if disaster strikes?
79

graphics, the site looks legitimate, too. Preventing corporate identity theft is not really feasible. With current HTTP and HTML technologies, corporations have no way to lock down their branding elements, so hackers can easily misappropriate them. Consumers will remain at risk until there is universal implementation of technology that verifies a Web site's legitimacy. Companies can take steps to protect their customers and deal quickly with identity theft incidents, but no computer system can be completely risk-free. Several proactive measures can protect information systems from threats. These measures can be grouped into four groups: deterrents, preventive countermeasures, corrective procedures and detection activities. Deterrents reduce the likelihood of deliberate attack. Both physical deterrents, such as limiting access to critical servers, and common deterrents, such as multi-level authentication, password protection, and biometric identification fall under this category. Preventive countermeasures shield vulnerabilities to render an attack unsuccessful or reduce its impact. Firewalls that prevent unauthorized access to a system and encryption that makes stolen data indecipherable are examples of preventive countermeasures. Corrective procedures reduce the effect of an attack. Data backups, disaster recovery plans, and the availability of redundant hardware devices all are examples of corrective procedures. Detection activities recognize attacks and trigger preventive countermeasures or corrective procedures. For example, antivirus software detects viruses entering a system and can be configured to perform corrective procedures such as removing the virus and quarantining infected files.
To help minimize risks the hardware and software for most corporate information systems are housed in data centers. A data center is a specialized facility designed to hold and protect computer systems and data. It includes special security features and is designed to proactively reduce the risk of data loss that might occur as a result of a disaster. Physical security is critical to data centers. Most data centers limit physical access using password protection and fingerprint identification systems. Motion detectors, automated alarm systems and many other Metrics prevent unauthorized movement through the building. For maximum protection, some data centers are housed in former military bunkers, abandoned mines, or limestone caves to provide protection against many natural disasters and a supply of uninterrupted power from high-capacity, battery-operated uninterruptible power supplies and backup power generators to keep computers functioning during power outages. But disaster recovery plans are also critical to data security. It is a step-by-step plan that describes the methods used to secure data against disaster and sets guidelines for how an organization will recover lost data if and when a disaster occurs. It must deal not only with calamities but also must take into account day-to-day events that could potentially cause data loss.

1. Who create computer programs?
2. How does a programmer plan a computer program? 3. What does the process of coding depend on?
4. What can cause program errors?
TEXT A: PROGRAMMING BASICS
Computer programs are developed by computer programmers or software engineers. Computer programming encompasses a broad set of activities that include planning, coding, testing, and documenting. Most programmers participate in all of these phases of program development, but focus on the coding process. Software engineers tend to focus on designing and testing activities.
The programming process begins with a problem statement that helps you clearly define the purpose of a computer program. In the context of programming, a problem statement defines certain elements that must be manipulated to achieve a result or goal. A good problem statement for a computer program has three characteristics:
 It specifies any assumptions that define the scope of the problem.
 It clearly specifies the known information.
 Itspecifieswhentheproblemhasbeensolved.
In a problem statement, an assumption is something you accept as true in
order to proceed with program planning. The known information in a problem statement is the information that you supply to the computer to help it solve a problem. After identifying the known information, a programmer must specify how to determine when the problem has been solved. Usually this step means specifying the output you expect.
A problem statement provides a minimal amount of planning, which is sufficient for only the simplest programs. A typical commercial application requires far more extensive planning, which includes detailed program outlines, job assignments, and schedules. Methodologies can be classified as predictive or agile.
A predictive methodology requires extensive planning and documentation up front. It allows little room for adaptation and change. Predictive methodologies are preferred for large software development projects. In contrast to predictive methodologies, an agile methodology focuses on flexible development and specifications that evolve as a project progresses. Programmers produce a subset of the entire project, show it to users, and then plan the next phase of development.
Programmers also approach problems in different ways. Whereas one programmer might focus on the steps required to complete a specific computation,
83

another programmer might focus on the data that forms the basis for the computation. The phrase programming paradigm refers to a way of conceptualizing and structuring the tasks a computer performs. Today’s most popular programming paradigms are:
   Description
Formulate programs as a series of objects and methods that interact to perform a specific task Focuses on the use of facts and rules to describe a problem
When planning is complete, programmers can begin coding, testing, and documenting. The process of coding a computer program depends on the programming language you use and the programming tools you select. Programming languages can be divided into two major categories: low-level languages (machine languages and assembly languages) and high-level languages (based on human languages).
Programmers can use a text editor, program editor, or VDE to code computer programs. A text editor is any word processor that can be used for basic text editing tasks, such as writing e-mail, creating documents, or coding computer programs. A program editor is a type of text editor specially designed for entering code for computer programs. A VDE (visual development environment) provides programmers with tools to build substantial sections of a program by pointing and clicking rather than typing lines of code. A typical VDE is based on a form design grid that a programmer manipulates to design the user interface for a program.
When a program doesn’t work correctly, it is usually the result of a syntax, logic, or runtime error. A syntax error occurs when an instruction does not follow the syntax rules, or grammar, of the programming language. Syntax errors are easy to make, but they are usually also easy to detect and correct. A runtime error occurs when a program runs. Some runtime errors result from instructions that the computer can’t execute. A logic error is a type of runtime error in the logic or design of a program, such as using the wrong formula. Logic errors can be caused by an inadequate definition of the problem or an incorrect formula for a calculation, and are usually more difficult to identify than syntax errors.
Programmers can locate errors in a program by reading through lines of code, much like a proof-reader. They can also use a tool called a debugger to step through a program and monitor the status of variables, input, and output.
Anyone who uses computers is familiar with program documentation in the form of user manuals and help files. Programmers also insert documentation called

TEXT B: OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
READING
Skim read the text and find the key words/phrases for each paragraph. Try to define them in your own words.
The traditional approach to programming uses a procedural paradigm to conceptualize the solution to a problem as a sequence of steps and it is very efficient for number-crunching tasks. The declarative paradigm describes aspects of a problem that lead to a solution and help to solve problems for non-numeric data, including words and concepts. The object-oriented paradigm is based on the idea that the solution for a problem can be visualized in terms of objects that interact with each other. It is efficient for problems that involve real-world objects.
Objects and classes. In the context of OO paradigm, an object is a unit of data that represents an abstract or a real world entity, such as a person, place, or thing. For
86

example, an object can represent a $10.99 small pepperoni pizza. Another one can represent a pizza delivery guy named Jack Flash. Yet another object can be a customer living at 22 Pointe Rd.
The real world contains lots of pizzas, customers, and delivery guys. These objects can be defined in a general way by using classes. Whereas an object is a single instance of an entity, a class is a template for a group of objects with similar characteristics. For example, a Pizza class defines a group of gooey Italian snacks that are made in a variety of sizes, crafted into rectangular or round shapes, and sold for various prices. A class can produce any number of unique objects.
When taking the object-oriented approach to a problem, one of the first steps is to identify the objects that pertain to a solution. As you might expect, the solution to the pizza problem requires some pizza objects. Certain characteristics of pizzas provide information necessary to solve the problem. This information – the price, size, and shape of a pizza – provides the structure for the Pizza class. A class is defined by attributes and methods. A class attribute defines the characteristics of a set of objects.
Each class attribute typically has a name, scope and data type. One class attribute of the Pizza class might be named «pizzaPrice». Its scope can be defined as public or private. A public attribute is available for use by any routine in the program. A private attribute can be accessed only from the routine in which it is defined. The pizzaPrice attribute’s data type can be defined as «double», which means that it can be any decimal number. OO programmers often use UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams to plan the classes for a program. Although a programmer completes the overall program plan before coding, jump ahead to take a quick look at the Java code for the attributes in the Pizza class. The first line of code defines the name of the class. Each subsequent line defines the scope, data type, and name of an attribute. The curly brackets simply define the start and end of the class.

Inheritance. The object-oriented paradigm endows classes with quite a bit of flexibility. For the pizza program, objects and classes make it easy to compare round pizzas to rectangular pizzas rather than just to square pizzas.
Suppose you want to compare a 10-inch round pizza to a rectangular pizza that has a length of 11 inches and a width of 8 inches. The Pizza class holds only one measurement for each pizza:pizzaSize. This single attribute won't work for rectangular pizzas, which might have a different length and width. Should you modify the class definition to add attributes for pizzaLength and pizzaWidth? No, because these attributes are necessary only for rectangular pizzas, not for round pizzas. An OO feature called «inheritance» provides flexibility to deal with objects’ unique characteristics.
87

In object-oriented jargon, inheritance refers to passing certain characteristics from one class to other classes. For example, to solve the pizza problem, a programmer might decide to add a RoundPizza class and a RectanglePizza class. These two new classes can inherit attributes from the Pizza class, such as pizzaShape and pizzaPrice. You can then add specialized characteristics to the new classes. The RectanglePizza class can have attributes for length and width, and the RoundPizza class can have an attribute for diameter.
The process of producing new classes with inherited attributes creates a superclass and subclasses. A superclass, such as Pizza, is any class from which attributes can be inherited. A subclass (or «derived class»), such as RoundPizza or RectanglePizza, is any class that inherits attributes from a superclass. The set of superclasses and subclasses that are related to each other is referred to as a class hierarchy. Java uses the extends command to link a subclass to a superclass. The statement class RectanglePizza extends Pizza means «create a class called RectanglePizza that’s derived from the superclass called Pizza».

Methods and messages. An OO program can use objects in a variety of ways. A basic way to use objects is to manipulate them with methods. A method is a segment of code that defines an action. The names of methods usually end in a set of parentheses, such as compare() or getArea().
A method can perform a variety of tasks, such as collecting input, performing calculations, making comparisons, executing decisions, and producing output. For example, the pizza program can use a method named compare() to compare the square-inch prices of two pizzas and display a message indicating the best pizza.
A method begins with a line that names the method and can include a description of its scope and data type. The scope – public or private – specifies which parts of the program can access the method. The data type specifies the kind of data, if any, that the method produces. The initial line of code is followed by one or more lines that specify the calculation, comparison, or routine that the method performs.
A method is activated by a message, which is included as a line of program code, sometimes referred to as a «call». In the object-oriented world, objects often interact to solve a problem by sending and receiving messages. For example, a pizza object might receive a message asking for the pizza’s area or price per square inch.
Polymorphism, sometimes called «overloading», is the ability to redefine a method in a subclass. It allows programmers to create a single, generic name for a procedure that behaves in unique ways for different classes. Polymorphism provides OO programs with easy extensibility and can help simplify program code.

Концепция объектно-ориентированного подхода в программировании схожа с восприятием окружающего мира человеком. Используя ОО подход, программист легче находит решение задач. Эффективность данной парадигмы состоит в том, что метод инкапсуляции позволяет адаптировать объекты и повторно использовать их в других программах. Инкапсуляция – это процесс сокрытия внутренних деталей объектов и их методов. После того, как объект кодируется, он превращается в «черный ящик», который скрывает все детали от других объектов и обеспечивает доступ к данным, используя «методы». Инкапсулированные объекты можно использовать повторно, изменять их, менять назначение. Потенциальным недостатком объектно-ориентированных

TEXT C: SECURE PROGRAMMING
READING
Study the key words of the text below and try to explain them in your own words.
Hackers, crackers, cybercriminals, or black hats—no matter what you call them; their goal is to gain unauthorized access to information. The first line of
     security holes, a buffer overflow, a verbose error message, randomization, to anticipate, vulnerabilities, a threat, to prevent, walkthroughs, mitigation strategies, to handle the failure, a patch
 90

defense in cyber security is computer programmers who create the applications, operating systems, and utilities that you use every day. Viruses, worms, bots, malicious Web scripts, and other exploits creep into computer systems through security holes, but why do these holes exist? Some of the most common software security defects include buffer overflows and verbose error messages.
A buffer overflow is a condition in which data in memory exceeds its expected boundaries and flows into memory areas intended for use by other data. Programmers can prevent buffer overflows by controlling pointers, checking input for suspicious characters, and placing strict boundaries on the values that can be stored in variables. A technique called address space randomization arranges key data areas in locations that are difficult for hackers to predict and target.
Good programmers try to anticipate how a program might fail and include code to handle the failure. Often, the result is an error message displayed to the user. When software is in developmental and testing phases, error messages can help programmers locate the source of errors. If those verbose error messages remain when the software ships, they can present attackers with information about the directory location of programs or files, the structure of a database, or the layout of the program in memory. Some of the most common examples of verbose error messages appear during unsuccessful attempts to log in or access files.
Software security begins when program specifications are formulated. Techniques such as formal methods, threat modeling, attack trees, and defensive programming help programmers remain aware of security throughout the software development life cycle.
Formal methods help programmers apply logical and mathematical models to software design, coding, testing, and verification. Formal methods, however, add to the cost and time of software development, so they tend to be used only for life- critical systems, such as air traffic control and nuclear reactor control systems.
Threat modeling is a technique that can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities by listing the key assets of an application, categorizing the threats to each asset, and developing threat mitigation strategies that can be implemented during coding. Threats can be categorized using a model like STRIDE:
Spoofing: Pretending to be someone else
Tampering: Changing, adding, or deleting data
Repudiation: Covering tracks to make attacks difficult to trace
Information disclosure: Gaining unauthorized access to information
Denial of service: Making a system unavailable to legitimate users
Elevation of privilege: Modifying user rights to gain access to data
Some threats are more likely to occur than others, and some threats have the potential to cause more damage than others. Software designers can rank threats using the DREAD categories:
Damage: How much damage can a particular attack cause?
Reproduce: Is this attack easy to reproduce?
Exploit: How much skill is needed to launch the attack?
Affected: How many users would be affected by an attack?
91

Discovered: How likely is it that this attack would be discovered?
Defensive programming is an approach to software development in which
programmers anticipate what might go wrong as their programs run, and take steps to smoothly handle those situations. Techniques associated with defensive programming include source code walkthroughs that can identify security holes; simplification of complex sections of code; filtering input. Signed code is a software program that identifies its source and carries a digital certificate. It ensures that the software will not run if even a single byte of the source code is changed by a virus or any other factor.
When software bugs are discovered, the programmer’s remaining line of defense is to produce a bug fix, or patch.
Computer users have no control over software at the code level, but there are a few steps they can take to avoid security problems:
 Select applications from software publishers with a good security track record.
 Read reviews of products before you download them and avoid software that doesn’t receive good reviews.
 Watch for patches and apply them.
 Consider using open source software, which has been extensively reviewed by the programming community.
 And yes, keep your firewall and antivirus software deployed and up to date. COMPREHENSION

UNIT 8. DATABASES
READING
Read the text and find answers to the questions.
1. What is a database? 2. What is data mining? 3. What is big data?
TEXT A: FILE AND DATABASE CONCEPTS
A database is a collection of information. Today, most databases are stored as computer files. Databases can incorporate several lists. For example, the database for an e-commerce site, such as Amazon.com, includes inventory lists and customer lists.
The tasks associated with creating, maintaining, and accessing the information in databases are referred to as data management, file management, or database management. Databases can be used in a variety of ways, from a simple tool for collecting and tracking data, to a comprehensive source for making decisions and predicting future trends.
Collect and store data. A database is a collection of data, but that collection grows as additional data is obtained. Data can be collected and entered manually or electronically. Information can also be removed from a database when it is no longer needed.
Update data. One of the primary database management activities is keeping data up to date by entering current addresses, inventory quantities, and so on. As with collecting data, updates can be made manually or electronically.
Organize and output data. The data in a typical database is stored in no particular order. New data is appended to the end of the file. To make data into a more suitable report, it can be organized in different ways. It can be alphabetized, placed in numeric order, grouped and subtotaled. Database output is easy to organize and reorganize without actually rearranging the physical data on the disk.
Distribute data. Databases, combined with mail merge and other computerized technologies, offer efficient ways to distribute information customers, employees, government agencies, and other companies.
Find data. Databases make it easy to locate information. A pharmacist can check a pharmaceutical database for drug interaction before filling a prescription. A
95

computer technician can check a manufacture’s database to find the part number for replacing your computer’s fried hard drive.
Analyze data. Databases include certain facts as raw data, such as names, addresses, bank balances, prices, and inventory quantities. Analyzing this data can produce information that is not readily apparent from simply looking at raw data.
What is data mining? Data mining refers to computer algorithms that analyze information to discover previously unknown and potentially useful information, including relationships and patterns. The data accessed by data mining and analysis techniques is often stored in a data warehouse, which is a storage for data from more than one database. Data from operational databases is transferred to a data warehouse where it can be combined with data from other databases to enhance the data set.
Predictive analytics refers to a branch of data mining that analyzes current and historical data to predict future trends. It makes use of statistical algorithms, neural networks and optimization research to discover patterns in data. For example, researchers might use it to predict customer behavior, unmask terrorists, forecast storm paths, etc. Like data mining, predictive analytics processes data autonomously, rather than under the direction of an operator who specifies what to look for.
OLAP (online analytical processing) is a data analysis technique that allows decision makers to quickly get answers to complex queries that encompass multiple factors, such as locations, revenue, time periods, and employee status. Unlike data mining and predictive analytics, OLAP is an interactive process that allows decision makers to devise unique queries, enter them, and get an immediate response.
Big data refers to huge collections of data that are difficult to process, analyze, and manage using conventional database tools. An example is the one million transactions generated by Wal-Mart sales registers every hour, which are stored in databases measured in petabytes, not gigabytes or terabytes.
The simplest model for storing data is a flat file that consists of a single, two- dimensional table of data elements. Each row in the table is a record, and each column of the table is a field. Computer databases display records as rows in a table or as forms.
A field contains the smallest unit of meaningful information, so you might call it the basic building block for a structured file or database. Each field has a unique field name that describes its contents. For example, in an iTunes playlist, the field called Name holds the name of a song, the Time field holds the song length, the Artist field holds the name of the performer, the Album field holds the name of the album and the Genre field holds the type of the song.
In the world of databases, a record refers to a collection of data fields. Each record stores data about one entity – a person, place, thing, or event. For example, a data record stored in an iTunes playlist contains fields of data pertaining to a digital music track.
Flat files are the foundation for simple databases, such as an e-mail address book, an iTunes playlist, or the addresses for a mail merge. Spreadsheets are also modeled on flat files. With a flat file, you can search for, update, group and organize
96

records. Each record in a flat file, however, is an independent entity and no relationships can be established between records.
The term DBMS (database management system) refers to software that is designed to manage data stored in a database. Each DBMS specializes in one database model, but some DBMS software offers versatility by dealing with a variety of models and data.
The Web allows access to many databases. When you shop at one online store, for example, the photos, descriptions, and prices you see are pulled from the merchant’s database and displayed as Web pages. More direct database access is offered by online public access catalogs. A database also provides the foundation for online access to course registration systems, real estate listings, movie reviews, flight schedules, and other information.
The Web provides both opportunities and challenges for accessing the information in a database. Obviously, with its global reach, the Web provides an opportunity for many people to gain access to data from multiple locations.
A technique called static Web publishing is a simple way to display the data in a database by converting a database report into an HTML document, which can be displayed as a web page by a browser. Static publishing provides extremely limited access to a database because it creates a Web page that displays a snapshot of your data at the time the report was generated. The advantages include security and simplicity. Your data remains secure because you have not provided direct access to your database, so unauthorized users cannot change your data.
In several situations, such as making e-commerce purchase or registering for a social networking site, it is important for people to use a browser to add or update records in a database.
So, many techniques exist for storing, accessing and displaying the data from databases. Individuals can use simple tools to create personal databases, such as address books. Corporate database managers, however, need to be familiar with more complex tools used to distribute data over networks and the Web. Sometimes more than one database management tool has the potential to work for a specific application.

TEXT B: DATABASE DESIGN
READING
Skim the text and find key words and phrases.
The term database structure refers to the arrangement of fields, tables, and relationships in a database. The first step in structuring a relational database is to determine what data should be collected and stored.
To do so, a database designer might begin by consulting users and studying the current filing system to compile a list of available data as well as any additional data necessary to produce on-screen output or printed reports. The next step is to organize that data into fields. It is usually easy to break data into fields just by using common sense and considering how people might want to access the data. Any data that people would want to search for, sort on, or use in a calculation should be in its own field.
The data that can be entered into a field depends on the field’s data type. From a technical perspective, a data type specifies the way data is represented on the disk and in RAM. From a user perspective, the data type determines the way data can be manipulated. When designing a database, each field is assigned a data type.
Data can be broadly classified as numeric or character. Character data contains letters, numerals, and symbols not used for calculations. Numeric data contains numbers that can be manipulated mathematically by adding, averaging, multiplying, and so forth.
There’s an old saying in the computer industry: «garbage in, garbage out». This adage is especially true when dealing with databases. The information produced by reports and processing routines is only as accurate as the information in the database. Unfortunately, data entry errors can compromise the accuracy and validity of a database. When designing a database, it is important to think ahead and envision potential data entry errors. Most DBMSs provide tools that database designers can use to prevent some, but not all, data entry errors.
A process called normalization helps database designers create a database structure that minimizes storage space and increases processing efficiency. The goal of normalization is to minimize data redundancy – the amount of data that is duplicated in a database. To normalize a database, one of the designer’s main tasks is to decide how best to group fields into tables.
The way that database queries, records, and reports appear on the screen depends on the user interface. An operating system provides some conventions for
99

the user interface, such as dialog box and button styles, but additional design decisions must be made for the database user interface.
Designing a database user interface can be a challenging task. If a company’s database includes multiple tables used by many different people, a professional user interface designer usually creates and maintains the user interface. Large databases might even require a group of user interface designers.
The interface for smaller databases, such as those used by small businesses or individuals, is most likely created by the database designer.
Some DBMSs include tools to create database interfaces. Others require separate tools for this task.
After the design for the database structure is complete, it is time to load the database with an initial set of data.
Data can be loaded into a database manually by using generic data entry tools supplied with the DBMS or by using a customized data entry module created by the database designer. Entering data manually can take a long time, however, and mistakes such as misspellings are common.
If the data exists electronically in another type of database or in flat files, it is usually possible to transfer the data using a custom-written conversion routine or import and export routines. A conversion routine converts the data from its current format into a format that can be automatically incorporated into the new database.
It takes some time and requires knowledge about database formats to write conversion routines; but for large databases, it’s much quicker to convert data than to re-enter it manually. Converting data also results in fewer errors.
Some DBMSs provide built-in import and export routines that automatically convert data from one file format to another. An import routine brings data into a database. For example, if data was previously stored as a spreadsheet file, an import routine in Microsoft Access can be used to transfer data from the spreadsheet to an Access database.
In contrast, an export routine copies data out of a software package, such as spreadsheet software, and into the database. You would use either an import routine or an export routine to move data from one location to another, but not both.
Query languages like SQL (Structured Query Language) work behind the scenes as an intermediary between the database client software provided to users and the database itself. Database client software provides an easy-to-use interface for entering search specifications, new records, data updates, and so on. The client software collects your input, and then converts it into an SQL query, which can operate directly on the database to carry out your instructions.
An SQL query is a sequence of words, much like a sentence. An SQL query begins with an action keyword, or command, which specifies the operation you want to carry out. The SQL query language provides a collection of special command words called SQL keywords, such as SELECT, FROM, INSERT, and WHERE, which issue instructions to the database.

TEXT C: DATABASE SECURITY
Databases are vulnerable to physical theft, hacking, and unauthorized access. A disk or tape containing a backup or an archive could be stolen. A laptop computer containing a database used by a field representative or teleworker can go missing. Hackers can gain unauthorized access to a database over the Internet or an unsecured wireless connection.
The qualities that make databases efficient also make them vulnerable. Data stored in digital format is easy to copy, back up, store, and transmit. Although it would be impractical to steal millions of paper records from filing cabinets, to steal a digital database, a criminal simply has to pocket a small backup drive or make a copy of the original database.
102

When a database is illicitly copied, it is stolen but not missing, as it would be if a crook made off with the folders in a filing cabinet. The theft might not be discovered for days or weeks, if ever, and affected individuals are never warned that their identities are at risk.
Privacy. You expect personal information to remain confidential. However, when your data is in a computer database, there is a risk that it can be viewed by unauthorized individuals or distributed without your permission. A preferred customer card at your favorite supermarket could be used to collect data about the groceries you purchase.
Accuracy. After accepting the fact that personal data is stored in countless databases, it would be comforting to know that the data is accurate. However, data entry errors, update errors, and hacking all add to doubt about the veracity of database data.
Security. Criminals have become sophisticated in the use of bots, key-loggers, and redirection to access data stored on personal computers and in corporate databases. The data stored in a single database is often sufficient to provide a criminal with enough information to access your bank account or use your credit card. New trends in data aggregation and analysis make it possible to assemble a detailed picture of an individual’s life with enough critical ID numbers and PINs to steal an entire identity and then run up debt, acquire a criminal record, and put a real person’s life in shambles.
Today’s computers are under assault from hackers and natural disasters. Although no computer system can be 100 % secure, system administrators can take steps to secure computer systems and the databases they contain. Security measures include encryption, access controls, data security policies, and intrusion monitoring.
Database data that’s transmitted over the Web can be encrypted using encryption technologies such as SSL. When that data arrives at the database, it is unencrypted and usually stored in plaintext. Encrypted databases are less efficient than unencrypted databases because all or part of the database has to be decrypted for the query to locate information.
Most operational databases are not encrypted while being used, but the data they contain can be encrypted before it is archived. Thieves who gain access to a database archive cannot make sense of the data if it is encrypted.
An access control limits access to systems, such as computer databases. Access controls can block unauthorized users and limit activities of authorized users. IT professionals sometimes classify access controls as identification and authentication, authorization, and accountability.
Identification and authentication determine who can access a database and the information it contains. Authorization defines what an authenticated user can do. Accountability tracks what a user did.
Basic security restricts physical access and network access to the computer that hosts the database. Physical access can be limited to authorized personnel by housing the computer in a locked data center. Online access can be limited by firewalls and passwords. System administrators should be sure to change all default administrator
103

passwords before opening the database to internal and external users. Security experts also recommend separating the server that hosts the database from the server that hosts publicly accessible services, such as Web pages.
A good set of policies decreases the risk of unauthorized access within the workplace, minimizes the chance of confidential data escaping from the workplace, and helps improve data entry accuracy.
Policies for retiring old equipment are also essential, and not just for computers. Modern office copier machines contain a hard disk, which stores images of every page that is copied. Removing and destroying storage devices from all discarded devices is a requirement for data security.
A database audit is a procedure that monitors and records user activity within a database. In some instances, auditing can identify intruders before they can compromise a system. If an intruder breaches database security, an audit can help to identify the damage and correct it.
Tracking who makes changes in a database helps an organization maintain accountability, trace the source of errors, and make corrections. If a database has been compromised by a hacker, an audit report can be used to check recent changes to the database to make sure they are legitimate.
If abnormal usage patterns become evident, database auditing tools can be configured to check specific types of database activity. For example, if a system administrator suspects that data is being surreptitiously deleted or changed, an audit can be set up to record any successful or unsuccessful deletions from tables in the database.
In the meantime, what to do? You can’t protect your personal data once you’ve released it, so the key to minimizing your risk is to be vigilant about the information you divulge. So, you should: know when data is being collected; find out how data is being used; find out what data is retained; supply only the data that is required; protect your passwords; not to trade your privacy; use antivirus software; not to reply to spam.
